Re-imagined expense reports
 
Expense report entry has been completely redesigned to simplify expense entry and decrease the time taken to enter an expense report. The major components of this new expense experience include:
•	A new expense management workspace including the ability to access your delegate's expenses
•	A new receipt matching experience to simplify attaching receipts to expense lines
•	Expense entry now has a grid to see many more expense lines and additional columns of data. Users can now see all itemized and split lines together with their parent expenses
•	Expense entry has a new pane on the right for all expense entry tasks
•	Errors, warnings, and policy messages have all been redesigned to ensure that the user has the correct context on what the issue is and how to resolve them. We've removed many messages that would appear before the user had a chance to complete their task and address them, such as the incomplete itemization message. 
•	A new form for detailed configuration of which fields are required by your organization, which fields are optional, and which fields should not be captured will help reduce the number of fields a user is required to enter
•	The look and feel of expense reports no longer feels like it is accounting centric
 
New features:
•	Added a new setup form for expense fields visibility to determine for an organization which fields are important for expense entry that they should appear for users on expense entry, or if they are optional to be shown on an optional screen to reduce the number of mandatory fields to be filled out.
•	Add unattached receipts to expense report is more visible from the workspace, and is more easily accessible within the expense report
•	Better visibility of expense lines containing warnings or errors
•	New Actions button for all of the line-level actions
•	New Header level button for document level actions
•	Add "required" as an option in expense fields visibility setup to determine if any field should be mandatory, such as additional information or merchant. 
•	New workspace to unify features and links that users had to click into different areas. For example, the delegate picker can be selected from within the workspace to quickly change between yourself and any users you are a delegate for
•	Add all or add selected for expenses and receipts during expense report creation
•	Exchange rate calculator during manual expense creation to calculate exchange rate and more quickly enter out of pocket multicurrency transactions
•	Save and New button introduced on new expense entry to rapidly enter expense lines
•	Added itemized and split lines directly into the list of expenses to increase visibility and easily determine if there are policy or other errors
•	Added support for receipts to show during itemization
•	Other user experience enhancements
 
 
The initial release will only focus on expense entry scenarios. Any expense report review or approval scenario will continue to use the legacy expense entry form.
