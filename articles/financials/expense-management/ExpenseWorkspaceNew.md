# Expense reports re-imagined

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Expense report entry has been redesigned to simplify and decrease the time to complete your expense report. The major components of this new expense experience include:
- A new expense management workspace including the ability to access your delegate's expenses
-	A new receipt matching experience to better show header-level receipts and simplify attaching receipts to expense lines
-	A new read-only grid to see many more expense lines and additional columns of data. Users can now see all itemized and split lines together with their parent expenses
-	A simplified pane for editing of expenses
-	Errors, warnings, and policy messages have all been redesigned to ensure that the user has the correct context on what the issue is and how to resolve them. We've removed many messages that would appear before the user had a chance to complete their task and address them, such as the incomplete itemization message. 
-	A new form for detailed configuration of which fields are required by your organization, which fields are optional, and which fields should not be captured will help reduce the number of fields a user is required to enter
-	The look and feel of expense reports no longer feels like its designed for accounting personas
 
To turn on the new experience use the Feature Management workspace to enable Expense reports re-imagined. Enabling the feature will do the following:
- Replace the existing expense workspace with the new workspace
- Add a new menu item for expense fields visibility
- The existing menu items for expense reports (the legacy form) and expense reports field will not be taken away
- Workflow and any approvals will still take you to the legacy expense reports form

 
## New features
|New feature | Description
|---|----|
| Expense fields visibility | New setup form to determine for an organization which fields should be disabled, which fields should be required, and which fields are recommended |
| Required fields | New simple configuration for making some fields required without having to use the policy framework | 
| Optional fields | A second screen for optional fields is added to keep employees from having to feel like they have to fill them out, but still easily accessible | 
| Add unattached receipts   | The ability to add unattached receipts to expense report is more visible from the workspace and within the expense report |
| Improved messaging | Better visibility of expense lines containing warnings or errors |
| Reduction in infolog messages | The number of infolog messages were decreased and work was done to eliminate duplicate messages from appearing in many cases | 
| Added focus for common actions | New actions button for most of the common line-level actions with an ellipsis button (...) for header and other less frequent actions | 
| New workspace to increase visibility | New workspace to unify features and links that users had to click into different areas |
| Add existing expenses and receipts during expense creation | Add all or add selected for expenses and receipts during expense report creation |
| Exchange rate calculator | Exchange rate calculator added to calculate exchange rate for out of pocket multicurrency transactions | 
| Save and New expense lines | Save and New button introduced on new expense entry to rapidly enter expense lines |
| Better visibility into split and itemized lines | Added itemized and split lines directly into the list of expenses to increase visibility and easily determine if there are policy or other errors | 
| Receipt shown during itemization | Added support for receipts to show during itemization |
  
The initial release will only focus on expense entry scenarios. Any expense report review or approval scenario will continue to use the legacy expense entry form.
