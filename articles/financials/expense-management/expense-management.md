#### What's new and in development

Go to the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Release Notes](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010158) to see what new features have been planned. 

##### Expense report entry
Expense report entry has been redesigned to simplify the experience and decrease the time to complete your expense report. You can enable this functionality in Feature management. You can add a new setup form to configure expense fields visibility and determine what data is required, optional, or not enabled for entering expense reports. A new expense workspace is enabled with this feature, replacing the previous expense workspace, and is the landing page for the improved entry experience.
