Calculating delivery dates
Calculate a delivery date for a line based on a vendor's lead time (Request for quotation reply form, Quotation tab) and your organization's working days calendar. Vendors can enter a lead time for each line. When a purchase order is confirmed, a delivery date for a line is calculated from the confirmation date, based on the lead time and the working days calendar. If no lead time is specified, the delivery date is the confirmation date. The lead time information for a line is available on these forms: Request for quotation reply, Purchase requisitions, Purchase agreements, and Purchase order. The lead time details are not overwritten when delivery dates are calculated for all lines in the form, byÂ using the Delivery dates button on the Calculate tab, on the Action Pane. You can update the lead time details for unconfirmed or unapproved records.
For a change order, you can update the record and recalculate a delivery date when you confirm the change order.
