This topic covers position budgeting functionality available for the public sector.  

You can maintain financial dimension default templates for forecast positions on the Forecast positions page by using controls on the Financial dimensions FastTab. The upper portion of the Financial dimensions FastTab displays all of the the distribution lines along with their percentage as a grid.  The lower portion of the Financial dimensions FastTab displays the position default dimensions.

You can validate whether a forecast position's default dimensions are correct for your organization's chart of accounts. For any forecast position, click the new Validate button on the Action Pane to see whether the financial dimension setup for your forecast position is valid. The validations are made against the account structure that you identify on the Human resources parameters [Need to find new page in D365] page. This quick validation can help you catch errors before you attempt to generate a budget plan from a forecast position. You can validate many positions from the Forecast positions list page.

You can also see the when the position was last validated in the Budget planning FastTab in the Forecast position validation section.  The validation fields are aslo included on the Forecast positions list page.
