You can maintain financial dimension default templates for forecast positions on the **Forecast position** page by using controls on the **Financial dimensions** FastTab. The upper portion of the **Financial dimensions** FastTab displays all of the the distribution lines along with their percentage as a grid. The lower portion of the **Financial dimensions** FastTab displays the position default dimensions.

You can validate whether a forecast position's default dimensions are correct for your organization's chart of accounts. For any forecast position, on the Action Pane, select **Validate** to see whether the financial dimension setup for your forecast position is valid. The validations are made against the account structure that you identify on the **Configure account structures** page. This quick validation can help you catch errors before you attempt to generate a budget plan from a forecast position. You can also validate many positions from the **Forecast positions** list page.

You can see the when the position was last validated on the **Budget planning** FastTab in the **Forecast position validation** section.  The validation fields are also included on the **Forecast positions** list page.
