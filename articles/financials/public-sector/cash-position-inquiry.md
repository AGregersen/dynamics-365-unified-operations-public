The Cash position inquiry allows you to determine the corresponding cash positions for financial dimension sets that contain self-balancing dimensions. The inquiry shows the beginning cash balance, and the effect of the addition of cash receipts, the subtraction of cash disbursements, and the subtraction of interfund transfers to arrive at an ending balance. Then, from the ending balance, general budget reservations, encumbrances, or pre-encumbrances are subtracted to arrive at an unencumbered balance.


This inquiry is unique in that it allows users to customize the terminology for column names and for the main accounts that are used to derive amounts for the columns. On the Cash position parameters page, the columns that appear in the inquiry are numbered starting with the left-most data column as column one.

Cash Position Inquiry Setup

1. Go to General ledger > Ledger setup > Cash position parameters.
2. In the Cash position parameters form, in the Column one group: 
- In the Column label field, type a label to use as the header for the report’s first column (for example, "Beginning balance").
- In the Opening balance main accounts field, select the account(s) that you want to reference for reporting on the opening balance.
3. In the Column two group: 
• Specify a label for the second column in the report (for example, "Cash receipts").
• In the Debit and credit main accounts list, select the main accounts from which to use only the sum of all debit and credit transaction amounts for the report's data. 
• Note
• The report will add the net of the debit and credit accounts plus the debit amount and credit amounts from the main accounts in the other fields in the group
• In the Debit-only main accounts list, select the main accounts from which to use only the sum of all debit transaction amounts for the report's data.
• In the Credit-only main accounts list, select the main accounts from which to use only the sum of all credit transaction amounts for the report's data.
4. In the Column three and Column four groups: 
• Specify a label for the third column (for example, "Cash disbursements") and fourth column (for example, "Intrafund transfers").
• For both columns, specify account numbers for the debit and credit main accounts, debit-only main accounts, and credit-only main accounts.
5. In the Column five group, specify a label for the fifth column (for example, Ending balance). 
Note
Microsoft® Dynamics® AX automatically calculates a sum from the accounts you specified for the first four columns: Beginning balance plus cash receipts, minus cash disbursements, minus intrafund transfers.
6. In the Column six and Column seven groups: 
• Specify a label for column six (for example, "GBRs" or "Auditor’s certificates") and column seven (for example, "Encumbrances").
• For both columns, specify account numbers for the debit and credit main accounts, debit-only main accounts, and credit-only main accounts.
7. In the Column eight group: 
• Specify a column label (for example, "Unencumbered balance"). 
• Note
• Dynamics AX automatically calculates a result from the accounts you specified for columns five through seven: Ending balance minus GBRs/auditor’s certificates, minus encumbrances.
