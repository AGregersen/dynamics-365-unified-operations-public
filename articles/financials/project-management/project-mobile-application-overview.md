# Project mobile applications overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


There are three project time mobile applications available for Microsoft Dynamics 365, including Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project
Timesheet, Project Time Entry, and My timesheets/Timesheets for my review
(Optimized for mobile).

## Project Timesheet mobile app
The Dynamics 365 Project Timesheet mobile app enables users to submit
and approve timesheet for projects on their mobile device. This mobile app
surfaces the timesheet functionality that resides in the Project management and
accounting area of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, improving
user productivity and efficiency, as well as enabling timely entry and approval
of project timesheets.

## Project Time Entry workspace
Project Time Entry workspace allows users to enter and save time against a
project. This application doesnâ€™t allow the worker to submit or approve a
project timesheet. It is intended for time entry. This mobile workspace is
intended to be used with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Unified Operations
mobile application.

## My timesheets/Timesheets for my review
My timesheets (Optimized for mobile) and Timesheets for my review (Optimized for
mobile) allows employees to create, submit, and approve project timesheets on a
mobile device. This solution allows the worker to access the Dynamics
365 for Finance and Operations functionality through the URL for the
application. It doesn't require the Dynamics 365 for Unified
Operations mobile application.

## For more information
For more details, see [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project timesheet mobile
application](project-timesheet.md), [Project time entry](
project-time-entry-mobile-workspace.md), and [Project timesheets on a mobile
device](Mobile-timesheets.md).
