# Enable multi-batch processing for GSTR reports 

Many tasks in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations can be run as part of a batch job. Batch jobs are generally created for tasks such as processing reports, coordinating schedule maintenance, and creating and sending documents, such as invoices. By using batch jobs, users can avoid slowing down their computers or the server during typical working hours. The tasks in a batch job can run sequentially, or at the same time.

In India, GSTR returns are required to be filed by every legal entity and the trasaction volume is typically very high as all sales and purchase invoice details are reported to the government. Currently, GSTR reports can be generated directly through the report dialog box or through the batch process. However there are times when the report generation process can take quite a while. To make this process more dynamic and efficient, the multi-batch processing feature is provided for GSTR reports. This will significantly improve the performance of report generation.

## Enable multi-batch processing feature 
Go to **Work spaces** \> **Feature management** and enable the multi-batch process feature.
