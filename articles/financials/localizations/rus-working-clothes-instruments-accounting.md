# Working clothes/Special riggings accounting
[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## About working clothes, and special rigging accounting
An organization must account for each working clothes item or special rigging asset that is issued to an employee, and create a Working clothes or Special rigging issue record. You can create queries to display all assets that are on-hand for employees and print the Working clothes issue sheet (No. MB-7). You can cancel or return the Working clothes or Special rigging issue to the inventory, and calculate the net book value and residual wearing period.

Working clothes and special rigging assets are regulated by their useful life cycle. This period starts when the item is written off from a warehouse and issued to an employee, and ends after a stipulated period of use. The useful lifetime is specified in months for each item. All of the data that pertains to an item is linked. This includes the identity of the employee, the useful life of the item, the date when the item is issued to the employee, and the calculated end date based on the rating of the item. When the end of the useful life approaches, the item is written off, so that it is no longer assigned to the employee.

During their life cycle, the cost of these types of assets must be amortized. If the life cycle is longer than 12 months, which is the legally defined rate, the linear method of depreciation is used. If it is less than 12 months, the cost is written off when the item is issued to the employee.

The Working clothes and Special rigging forms are similar to the Fixed assets page, which accounts for all issued working clothes and special rigging.

It is necessary to execute the following settings for accounting working clothes item or special rigging assets.

## Create a working clothes or special rigging issue journal 

Use the **Working clothes/Special rigging/NVFA issue** form to issue an item from the warehouse to an employee. Working clothes, special rigging items, and not valuable fixed assets (NVFAs) are separate assets. When an issue journal is posted, separate cards are created in the **Working clothes**, **Special rigging**, and **Not valuable FAs** pages.

When new working clothes or special rigging items are issued, the following actions occur:

  - A working clothes or special rigging card is created for each journal line, and the lines are updated in the **Working clothes** or **Special rigging** page.

  - The fixed asset (FA) number for the asset is generated based on the number sequence that is specified in the **Fixed asset parameters** page.

  - The quantity of the working clothes or special rigging item is equal to the item quantity that is specified on the journal line. In the **Componentry** form, the quantity of the corresponding item is updated to 1 for each asset that is created.

  - The value models and depreciation group are also updated in the cards. If you select the **Service life by rate** check box in the **FA value models** form, the wearing period, or usage, is determined based on the depreciation groups. If the **Service life by rate** check box is cleared, the wearing period is selected from the issued journal line. The cost is the same for all value models and is selected from the cost price of this item line.

  - The status of the asset is updated to **Scheduled**. Additionally, the acquisition date is updated with the date of the journal transaction, and the acquisition amount is updated with the cost price that is posted for the item line.

When a used working clothes or special rigging card is issued, if the serial number of the card for the issued item has already been filled in the inventory transaction that corresponds to the posted journal line, the following actions occur:

  - The issue journal that was created earlier is searched and copied by using the serial number inventory dimension.

  - The cost price is selected from the item cost price for the base value model.

  - The useful life is updated for the working clothes or special rigging item.

  - The residual wearing or usage period is calculated by subtracting the past lifetime from the lifetime by rate.
