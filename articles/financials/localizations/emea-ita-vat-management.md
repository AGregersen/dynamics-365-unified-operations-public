# VAT management and reporting by tax point date

## Introduction

On 23rd of October 2018 in Italy the Law Decree 119 (L.D.119/2018) introduced a change in value-added tax (VAT) management in Italy that takes effect on July 1, 2019. Here is a summary of the change:

-	VAT payers can recover the input VAT in the VAT settlement for the month when the VAT point is triggered, even if the purchase invoice is received and recorded in the input VAT ledger before the fifteenth day of the next month. This rule doesn’t apply to transactions where the VAT point is triggered in a fiscal year that differs from the fiscal year in which the purchase invoice is received.

-	For supplies of services and supplies of goods, the invoice can be issued by the fifteenth day of the month after the month in which the VAT point was triggered. Invoices that are issued and booked before the fifteenth day of the month after the month in which the VAT point was triggered must be included in the VAT settlement of the previous month.

-	Starting on July 1, 2019, the invoice can be issued within 10 days of the VAT point. If the invoice isn’t issued at the VAT point, it should include, in addition to the invoice date, a reference to the VAT point date.

Invoices that are booked before the fifteenth day of the next month, but that have a reference to the previous VAT settlement, should not interrupt the sequential posting. Invoices with VAT point date in the previous month but invoice date in the current month should be booked in a chronological sequence with the invoices in the current month  with a reference to the fact that these invoices are related to the previous VAT settlement.

Companies that issue the sales invoice on the same day, without applying the change that is introduced by L.D.119/2018, remain compliant.
