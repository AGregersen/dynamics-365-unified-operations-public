# Scope of India localization

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Generally, Microsoft deploys significant resources in generating the business process functionality of Microsoft Dynamics applications by developing the features and functionality to address certain tax accounting or financial regulatory requirements in countries where Microsoft Dynamics® is generally available. 
Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations helps business operations manage their obligations to comply with country-specific laws, regulations, and common business practices for handling routine activities. The software is designed with features and functionality to address specific central and state government taxes, accounting, and financial or statutory reporting laws or regulations that usually govern business in India. However, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations does not cover all laws, regulations, or commercial requirements in India, because laws and regulations are diverse and numerous. For example, regulatory features that Microsoft creates and makes generally available for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations in India do not usually support industry-specific laws or national standards, particular state-specific laws, or city or municipal law requirements except as is specifically noted in this document. 
As per the global strategy to deliver Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations channel partners are a very important part of the process and their deliberation crystallizes the thought process and helps Microsoft to design a roadmap to achieve excellence in localization requirements. The flexible, need-based architecture of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations is useful for channel partners in addressing a customer’s specific business needs during development, configuration, and implementation. Although channel partners may provide solutions that meet specific regulatory requirements that are unique to cities, states, or other regions in India, Microsoft does not provide any guarantees or warranties (expressed, implied, statutory, or otherwise) that partner-created solutions comply with local business, tax, and regulatory, legal, or other applicable requirements. Channel partners or customers are solely responsible for any configurations, customizations, localizations, or translations (including any update for each of the same) that they create or implement on behalf of customers. This includes any support or other service that is provided to customers for such solutions. User must contact their channel partner for information about the solutions that they create for licensed versions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. 
This document shows the strategy and scope of localization that Microsoft has implemented as part of the version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations that is commercially available in India. 

## Definitions

**Customization**: 

- Any configuration, modifications, or changes that are made by partners or customers to Microsoft Dynamics software or, when applicable, software documentation to fit a customer’s specific business needs (such as adding or renaming fields or tables, creating custom reports, integrating with third-party solutions, and so on); 
- Any software developed by or for partners or customers for the Microsoft Dynamics software.

**Localization**: Any modification to, addition to, or adaptation of Microsoft Dynamics software to enable or include certain features or functionality in the software to comply with applicable regulatory requirements (including, without limitation, versions and updates of the Microsoft Dynamics software, user assistance tools, or end-user documentation). Examples of laws or regulatory requirements that may require localization of software include local tax reporting (such as GST, Customs and Tax Deduction at Source [TDS]/Tax collection at source [TCS], specific law driven- tax calculations [such as reverse charge ,Price exclusive, Price inclusive tax, and so on]), local accounting rules, and local regulatory and statutory reporting.

**National Standards**:  Local requirements that are not required by law or regulation but are widely adopted inside a geographic region and are critical to the sale of licenses for business management software in that geographic region.

## India localization strategy
In order to address the tax (direct/indirect), financial accounting, and statutory reporting requirements for India, the strategy that was adopted by Microsoft strategy to provide localizations for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations  consists of the following:   

•	Meet the Central-level tax requirements that are described in the India localization scope section.
•	Meet state-specific/region-specific tax requirements if they are generic across all states in India. This policy is described in the India localization scope section. 
•	Meet tax requirements on Export and Import transactions that are described in the India localization scope section.
•	Deliver new regulatory feature requirements through configurations or new development according to the localization scope and rules that are specified in this document and implementation opportunities that are driven by the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations roadmap.
•	Deliver new regulatory features for all supported versions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.
•	Does not focus on requirements of specific businesses, segments, verticals, regions, even when this is required by laws, statutes, or regulations at the federal, state, or city levels. 
•	Does not include city-specific tax requirements, except for those that are described in the India localization scope section.
There are specific laws and requirements that are out of scope for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.
The localization for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations that is developed by Microsoft is limited to the features and functionality that are described in this document. Therefore, the localization for Microsoft Dynamics 365 must be analyzed by prospective customers or a tax professional (such as an accounting and tax auditor, tax law firm, or tributary consulting firm) who can perform an assessment to determine whether the functionality will meet the customer’s business needs, or whether custom solutions are required. 
India localization scope
The Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations localization provides configuration for language user interface and Help settings. India localization is available in English IN. Additional documentation such as white papers and comprehensive training materials are also available in English. 
The localization scope for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations in India is limited to fiscal and financial accounting transactions in the following areas: 
•	Tax 
•	General ledger
•	Accounts payable
•	Accounts receivable
•	Inventory management
•	Product information and Management 
•	Organization and Management 
•	Project & Service Management

•	Retail 

The features that Microsoft delivers and supports as part of the India localization for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations are listed in Table . 

Market availability 
Microsoft tries to deliver regulatory updates and changes with enough time for installation and implementation. Our goal is to release tax and regulatory updates to be incorporated into Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations in advance of the effective date or other date that is mandated by the tax authorities, regardless of whether it is central or state government tax, so that our channel partners can acquaint themselves with features and have enough time to update their customer solutions. Internally, we call this delivery date the “market required date” (MRD). 
We try to meet our established MRDs and dates that are mandated by the various government authorities. However, various factors can adversely affect the timely delivery of tax and regulatory updates. These include the following: 
•	Legislative or regulatory changes that are made by the government with short notice before the date of law enforcement
•	Feature, functionality, infrastructure, or architectural limitations of the affected software versions that are generally available in the marketplace 
•	Complexity and coverage of the coding, redesign, or improvement of the software that is required to implement the legislation or regulatory requirements 
•	Schedule conflicts
In any situation in which Microsoft finds it difficult to meet these dates, we use reasonable efforts to develop and release tax and regulatory updates as soon as possible.
Disclaimer: 
Any dates that Microsoft publishes are for planning only and are subject to change at any time without notice.
Microsoft makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees about the timeliness or completeness of any tax or regulatory updates it provides and, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, disclaims all implied warranties and conditions, such as implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
