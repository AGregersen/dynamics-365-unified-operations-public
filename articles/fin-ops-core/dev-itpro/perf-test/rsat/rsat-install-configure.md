# Regression Suite Automation Tool installation and configuration

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic contains information about how install and configure the Regression suite automation tool (RSAT).

## Prerequisites

### Test environment
Your test environment must be running Platform update 15 or newer. The Regression suite automation tool must have access to your test environment via a web browser.  

### Excel
You need Microsoft Excel installed to generate and edit test parameters. 

### Azure DevOps
You must have an Azure DevOps project to store and manage your test cases, test plans, and test case results. You will need an Azure DevOps Test Manager or Test Plans license. For example, if you have a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription, you already have a license to Test Plans. For more information, see [Pricing for Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/).

### Authentication Certificate
RSAT is designed to be installed on any Windows 10 computer and connect remotely via a web browser to a an environment.

![Client computer and environment](media/client-environment.png)

To enable secure authentication, RSAT requires a certificate to be installed on the RSAT client computer. The RSAT settings dialog box allows you to automatically create and install the authentication certificate. You will also need to configure the virtual machine (VM) to trust the connection. Follow the instructions in the next sections to install and configure RSAT.

## Installation

### Installer
Download **Regression Suite Automation Tool.msi** to your machine and double-click it to run the installer.

![RSAT settings](media/rsat-settings.png)

### General settings
These settings are required.

#### Azure DevOps
Configure your connection to the Azure DevOps project and test plan.

+ **Azure DevOps Url** - This is the URL of your Azure DevOps organization. For example, https://yourAzureDevOpsUrlHere.visualStudio.com.
+ **Access Token** - The access token that allows the tool to connect to Azure DevOps. You need to create a Personal Access Token or use an existing one that you have saved. For more information, see [Authenticate access with personal access tokens](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/setup-admin/team-services/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate). 
+ **Project Name** - The name of your Azure DevOps project. RSAT will automatically detect project names and test plans available based the Azure DevOps URL specified. You can then select the Test Project and Test Plan.
+ **Test Plan** - The Azure DevOps test plan that contains your test cases. For more information, see [Create test plans and test suites](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/test/manual-exploratory-testing/getting-started/create-a-test-plan). 

Select **Test Connection** to test your connection to Azure DevOps.

#### Test Environment
Configure your connection to the test environment.

+ **Hostname** - Hostname of the test environment. For example, <myaos>.cloudax.dynamics.com. Do not include the https:// or http:/ prefix.
+ **SOAP Host Name** - SOAP Hostname of the test environment. The SOAP hostname is typically the same as the Hostname with a soap suffix. For example, <myaos>soap.cloudax.dynamics.com. Do not include the https:// or http:/ prefix.
+ **Admin User Name** - Email address of an admin user on the test environment.
+ **Thumbprint**: Thumbprint of the authentication certificate you are using.
    1. Select **New** to create and install a new authentication certificate. When prompted, place the .cer file somewhere so you have it saved for your records.
    2. When the process completes, the new certification is installed in the local machineâ€™s trusted root store.
        
        ![Successfully created](media/thumbprint-certificate.png)

    3. The thumbprint of the newly created certificate is automatically inserted on this form. Copy this thumbprint, you will use it in the next section to configure the AOS to trust the connection.

+ **Company name** - Specify a company name to use as your default company during creation of Excel pParameters files. It can be changed later by editing an Excel file.


#### Run setting
Configure your local settings.

+ **Working directory** - Folder location for storing test automation files, including Excel test data files. For example: **C:\Temp\RegressionTool**.
+ **Default browser** - Select the browser to use for test execution.

Select **Ok** to apply your settings and close the dialog box. Select **Cancel** to cancel your changes and close the dialog. The **Save As** and **Open** buttons allow you to save your settings for reuse later. Select **Save As** to save your current settings into a configuration file on your computer. Select **Open** to restore your settings from a configuration file.

### Optional Settings
Select the **Optional** tab to configure optional settings.

+ **Test Run Prefix** - RSAT reports test run results to Azure DevOps. Test runs are named using the following convention: **<Run ID> <Prefix> <Test Suite>**. Use this setting to set the **<Prefix>**.
+ **Test Run Timeout** - Timeout (in minutes) of a test run. All active windows are closed and pending test cases fail when this timeout is reached.
+ **Test Action Timeout** - Timeout (in minutes) of individual test steps. When a test step times out, the test case fails.

### Configure the AOS machine to trust the connection
After creating the certificate, configure AOS to trust the test automation connection. On a multi-AOS environment, repeat the following steps for all AOS machines.

1.	Open a Remote Desktop connection to the AOS machine.
2.	Open IIS and find AOSService in the list of sites.

    ![Find AOS in IIS](media/configure-aos.png)

3.	Right-click **AOSService**, then click **Explore**.
4.	Open and find the file **wif.config**.
  
    ![Open wif.config](media/open-wif-config.png)

5.	Update the **wif.config** file by adding a new authority entry, as shown in the following example. Use **127.0.0.1** for the authority name and paste your certificate thumbprint.

    ```xml
    <issuerNameRegistry type="Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.Security.SharedUtility.AxIssuerNameRegistry, Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.Security.SharedUtility">
        <authority name="CN=127.0.0.1">
            <keys>
                <add thumbprint="ccbc124d0a119xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx841e797" />
            </keys>
                <validIssuers>
                    <add name="CN=127.0.0.1" />
                </validIssuers>
        </authority>
    ```

## Installation on multiple machines
If you install RSAT on more than one computer, you need to generate a new certificate for every RSAT installation. The certificate must be generated and installed on the same computer as RSAT. You can have more than one thumbprint entry in the AOS wif.config file if you want your AOS to trust connections from more than one client where RSAT is installed. The following example shows multiple thumbprints nodes.

```xml
<keys>
    <add thumbprint="ccbc124d0a119xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx841e797" />
    <add thumbprint="bbbbbbbbbbbbbbxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx999999" />
</keys>
```

## Install Selenium drivers

For manual installation of Selenium drivers, follow these steps:
1. Download [Selenium 3.13.1](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/3.13/selenium-dotnet-strongnamed-3.13.1.zip). Or, go to http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download and click **Previous releases**. Choose **3.13** and download **selenium-dotnet-strongnamed-3.13.1.zip**.
2. Install the Selenium libraries:
    + Unzip the downloaded file. 
    + Unpack the file **dist\Selenium.WebDriver.StrongNamed.3.13.1.nupkg**. To unpack this file, add the .zip suffix to the file and unzip it. 
    + Copy the contents of the folder named **Selenium.WebDriver.StrongNamed.3.13.1.nupkg\lib** to **C:\Program Files (x86)\Regression Suite Automation Tool\Common\External\Selenium**.

3. Unzip the downloaded file and move the contents to **C:\Program Files (x86)\Regression Suite Automation Tool\Common\External\Selenium**.

## Manual configuration of authentication certificates

Optionally, you can manually configure the RSAT authentication certificate.

If you are not familiar with this process, get help from your system administrator. Make sure you have Windows Kits installed on your machine. If you do not have Windows Kits installed on your machine, you can download the Windows 10 SDK from [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk). You will need these components for the steps described in this document.

+ Windows SDK Signing Tools for Desktop Apps
+ Windows SDK for UWP Managed Apps.

### Generate the certificate

You must generate the certificate file on the RSAT client computer. **The certificate must be generated on the same computer that the test tool is running on.** To generate the certificate file, follow these steps:
1. Create the **C:\Temp** folder if it does not already exist on your computer.
2. Open a command line window as Administrator.
3. Go to the folder where you installed the Windows SDK. Your exact folder may be different, depending on where you have installed the windows SDK). You can also use Windows Kits 8.1.

    ```Console
    cd c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.17763.0\x64
    ```

4. Run the following command. When you are prompted to enter a private key password, enter **None**. 

    ```Console
    makecert.exe -n "CN=127.0.0.1" -ss My -sr LocalMachine -a sha256 -len 2048 -cy end -r -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 c:\temp\authCert.cer
    ````

### Install the certificate to the Trusted Root

To install the certificate, follow these steps:

1. Double-click **authCert.cer** to install the certificate.
2. Click **Install Certificate**.
3. Select **Local Machine > Place all certificates in the following Store > Browse > Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and click **Next** through each screen.
4. Leave the **Password** field blank.
5. In the **Certificate** dialog box, browse to **Details** and look for **Thumbprint**.
