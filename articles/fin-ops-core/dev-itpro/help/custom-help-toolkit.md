# Custom Help Toolkit

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft has published a GitHub repository with scripts and tools that can help you prepare content so that it can be accessed from the Help pane in the client that is used by the Finance and Operations apps. This way, users of custom solutions that are based on Finance and Operations apps can have access to context-sensitive Help.  

## Tools in the toolkit

The toolkit is available at [https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365f-o-custom-help/](https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365f-o-custom-help/) and provides the following tools as well as the source code for the tools:

- HtmlFromRepoGenerator tool
