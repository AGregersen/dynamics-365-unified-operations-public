# Custom Help Toolkit

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft has published a GitHub repository (repo) with scripts, and tools that can help you prepare content so that it can be accessed from the Help pane in the Finance and Operations client. This way, users of custom solutions that are based on Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, Retail, or Talent can have access to context-sensitive Help.  

The toolkit is available at [https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365f-o-custom-help/](https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365f-o-custom-help/).

## <a name="consoleapp"></a>Use the ConsoleApp to get MarkDown files and generate HTML files

ConsoleApp.exe provides functionality that supports the creation of custom Help. It is available from [the content tools repo](https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365f-o-custom-help/tree/master/docfx%20scripts). You can use ConsoleApp.exe to:

- Clone a Microsoft documentation repo

    If you already have a clone of the Microsoft repo, your can run ConsoleApp without this command.

- Remove developer and administrator content from your clone of the Microsoft repo.
- Update links to files that are no longer in the clone.
- Update the **ms.locale** value to match the language options that are supported by the Finance and Operations client.

    The Finance and Operations client uses different language descriptors compared to the corresponding documentation repos on GitHub. For localized Help to be called, the language indicators of the content that has been downloaded from GitHub localized repos must be changed so that they match the language descriptors of the Finance and Operations client.
- Generate HTML files that can be used for publishing.
- Compare a localized Microsoft repo to the en-US repo to identify discrepancies and update the links accordingly.

Here is the syntax for ConsoleApp.exe:  

```
ConsoleApp.exe --Json <Articles/> --Out <path> --ExternalText <text> [--DoNotClone <true|false>] [--Repo <URL>] [--RemoveGitFolder <true|false>] [--ReplaceUrl <URL>] [--LogsDir <.\logs>] [--EnRepo <URL>] [--EnOut <path>] [--Lng <language code>] [--?[-]]
```

Here is an explanation of the parameters:

|Parameter   |Description  |
|------------|-------------|
|Json |Specify a relative path for the location of the docfx.json file. In Microsoft documentation repos, this location is typically ```articles/```. |
|Out |Specify the folder where your existing clone is, or the folder to clone the repo to. If you run ConsoleApp to clone a repo, this folder must not already exist. Use the language name as the folder name as described in [Language and locale descriptors in across product and Help](language-locale.md). |
|ExternalText |Specify text that must be added to the updated links if ConsoleApp must replace the original links.|
|DoNotClone |Set this parameter when you run the tool against previously cloned repos. |
|Repo |Specify the repo URL. This parameter is not required if you are using a previously cloned repo. Examples of Microsoft documentation repo URLs include *https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Unified-Operations-public* for English (US) and *https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Operations.ar-sa* for Arabic (Saudi Arabia).|
|RemoveGitFolder|Specify whether to remove the .git folder.|
|ReplaceUrl|Specify the URL that is used to replace links between files when those files are not present. This parameter is intended to be used to turn relative links into absolute links.|
|LogsDir|Specify the folder to save logs files to.|

The following additional parameters are used when the tool is run against the localized Microsoft documentation repos:

|Parameter   |Description  |
|------------|-------------|
|EnRepo|Specify the URL of the en-US repo. This parameter is not required if the repo is already cloned. The Microsoft documentation repo URL for English (US) is *https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Unified-Operations-public*.|
|EnOut|Specify the folder where the en-US repo exists or the folder that it should be cloned to. This folder should not exist if the repo is being cloned by the tool.|
|Lng|Specify the language value to use for ms.locale metadata in the resulting HTML files. The value must correspond to the value that is used in the Finance and Operations clientâ€™s language setting that the Help content is intended for. If this parameter is omitted, en-US is used as a default value. Use the Finance and Operations language name as a parameter. For more information, see [Language and locale descriptors in across product and Help](language-locale.md).|
|Rtl|Set this parameter if the language uses right-to-left (RTL) formatting. Examples of RTL languages include Arabic and Hebrew.|

### Examples

The following example clones the en-US repo and generates HTML files for en-US.

```
ConsoleApp.exe --json articles/ --out "D:\D365-Operations\en-US" --repo "https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-unified-Operations-public" --externalText "(This is an external link)" --replaceUrl "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain" --LogsDir D:\D365-Operations\logs\en-US
```

The following example uses the previously cloned en-US repo and generates HTML files for en-US.

```
ConsoleApp.exe --json articles/ --out "D:\D365-Operations\en-US" --externalText "(This is an external link)" --replaceUrl "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain" --LogsDir D:\D365-
Operations\logs\en-US
```

The following example clones both the de-DE and en-US repos, and generates HTML files for German.

```
ConsoleApp.exe --json articles/ --out "D:\D365-Operations\de" --repo "https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Operations.de-de" --externalText "(This is an external link)" --EnRepo "https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-unified-Operations-public" --EnOut "D:\D365-Operations\en-us" --replaceUrl "https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dynamics365/supply-chain" --lng "de" --LogsDir D:\D365-Operations\logs\de
```

The following example clones the de-DE repo, uses the existing en-US repo, and then generates HTML files for de.

```
ConsoleApp.exe --json articles/ --out "D:\D365-Operations\de" --repo "https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Operations.de-de" --externalText "(This is an external link)" --EnOut "D:\D365-Operations\en-us" --replaceUrl "https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dynamics365/supply-chain" --lng "de" --LogsDir D:\D365-Operations\logs\de
```

The following example uses the existing de-DE and en-US repos, and then generates HTML files for German. Make sure that the de-DE repo is up to date if you use the existing repo.

```
ConsoleApp.exe --json articles/ --out "D:\D365-Operations\de" --DoNotClone --externalText "(This is an external link)" --enOut "D:\D365-Operations\en-us" --replaceUrl "https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dynamics365/supply-chain" --lng "de" --LogsDir D:\D365-Operations\logs\de
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ConsoleApp.exe should not be run repeatedly on the repo, because the folder that contains repository files is already modified. Therefore, the files no longer contain the correct links that must be replaced. If you must rerun the tool, either let the tool re-clone the repo, or make sure that all local changes are reverted.

<!--TODO: Figure out what that alert really means. What is a one-off task and what is a regular task?-->

## <a name="json"></a>Use the ConvertHtmlToJson tool to generate JSON files

[The ConvertHtmlToJson tool](https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365f-o-custom-help/tree/master/Help%20Pane%20extension) transforms HTML files into JSON files that you can then add to the Azure Search service that will generate context-sensitive links to your Help content.  

When you run the ConvertHtmlToJson tool, you must specify the location of the HTML files with your Help content, and you must specify the destination path.  

<!--TODO: Examples?-->

## <a name="helppane"></a>Use the development environment to extend the Help pane

The **Help Pane extension** folder of the toolkit contains the **AzureSearchCustomHelp** solution that you can open in the Finance and Operations development environment. The same folder also contains the **HelppaneOption.axpp** project that you can then import into the solution in Visual Studio.  

For an example of how to extend the Help, see [Connect your Help website with the Help pane](deploy.md#extendhelppane).
