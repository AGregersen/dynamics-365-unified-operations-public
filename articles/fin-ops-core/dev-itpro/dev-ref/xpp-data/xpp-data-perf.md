# Conversion of operations from set-based to record-by-record

You can use the following statements to improve performance by reducing communication between the application and the database:

- [RecordSortedList](../r-classes#class-recordsortedlist)
- [RecordInsertList](../r-classes#class-recordinsertlist)
- [insert_recordset](xpp-insert.md#insert-recordset-statement)
- [update_recordset](xpp-update.md#update-recordset-statement)
- [delete_from](xpp-delete.md#delete-from-statement)

There are situations where these record setâ€“based operations can be converted to slower record-by-record operations. The following information identifies these situations.

## Non-SQL tables

| Operation | Can be converted |
|---|---|
|DELETE_FROM|Yes|
|UPDATE_RECORDSET|Yes|
|INSERT_RECORDSET|Yes|
|ARRAY_INSERT|Yes|
|Use this setting for overrides|Not applicable|

## Delete actions

| Operation | Can be converted |
|---|---|
|DELETE_FROM|Yes|
|UPDATE_RECORDSET|No|
|INSERT_RECORDSET|No|
|ARRAY_INSERT|No|
|Use this setting for overrides|**skipDeleteActions**|

## The database log is enabled

| Operation | Can be converted |
|---|---|
|DELETE_FROM|Yes|
|UPDATE_RECORDSET|Yes|
|INSERT_RECORDSET|Yes|
|ARRAY_INSERT|No|
|Use this setting for overrides|**skipDatabaseLog**|

## Overridden method

| Operation | Can be converted |
|---|---|
|DELETE_FROM|Yes|
|UPDATE_RECORDSET|Yes|
|INSERT_RECORDSET|Yes|
|ARRAY_INSERT|Yes|
|Use this setting for overrides|**skipDataMethods**|

## Alerts are set up for the table

| Operation | Can be converted |
|---|---|
|DELETE_FROM|Yes|
|UPDATE_RECORDSET|Yes|
|INSERT_RECORDSET|Yes|
|ARRAY_INSERT|No|
|Use this setting for overrides|**skipEvents**|

## The ValidTimeStateFieldType property on a table isn't equal to None

| Operation | Can be converted |
|---|---|
|DELETE_FROM|Yes|
|UPDATE_RECORDSET|Yes|
|INSERT_RECORDSET|Yes|
|ARRAY_INSERT|Yes|
|Use this setting for overrides|Not applicable|

You can use the settings that are shown for **Use this setting for overrides** to explicitly skip or ignore one or more factors that adversely affect performance. If, for some reason, one of the previously mentioned SQL operations is downgraded to a record-by-record operation, all the **skip\*** settings are also ignored. For example, in the following code, the **insert** method on the myTable table is run, even though it's explicitly stated that this method should be skipped if a container or memo field is defined for myTable.

```X++
public void tutorialRecordInsertList()
{
    MyTable myTable;
    RecordInsertList insertList = new RecordInsertList(
        myTable.TableId,
        True);
    int i;
    for ( i = 1; i <=  100; i++ )
    {
        myTable.value = i;
        insertList.add(myTable);
    }
    insertList.insertDatabase();
}
```
