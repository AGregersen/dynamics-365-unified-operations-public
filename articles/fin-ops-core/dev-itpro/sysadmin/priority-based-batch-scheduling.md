Priority based batch scheduling (preview)
=========================================

With the release of Platform update 31, it is possible to enable **Batch
priority-based scheduling**, in [Feature
management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview).
Priority based scheduling decouples batch groups from batch server and instead
uses relative scheduling priorities to determine the sequence in which tasks are
executed across available batch servers. This feature is currently available for
customers on a restricted basis.

**Scheduling priority** is defined on batch groups and can optionally be
overridden on jobs. It is used to declare relative priorities of jobs/business
processes. The available values for Scheduling Priority are: Low, Normal, High,
Critical and Reserved Capacity. The priority classification is used to determine
the processing sequence when a job is scheduled to be processed. **Reserved
capacity** represents the highest priority and additional functionality is
planned for future updates.

**Priority based batch scheduling** requires that also the **Batch framework
contention reduction** feature is enabled in **Feature Management**.

The following procedures describes the how to work with Batch groups, jobs and
tasks, when the **Priority based batch scheduling** is enabled.

Batch groups
============

Batch groups are now only used to logically group jobs and to set the default
Scheduling priority. Examples of batch groups include the following:

-   Jobs that belong to a specific business process

-   Jobs that share the same execution recurrenceâ€”for example every night, every
    week, or every month

-   Jobs that share the same priority

Use the following procedure to create a batch group.

Create a batch group
--------------------

1.  Go to **System administration \> Setup \> Batch group**.

2.  Click **New** to create a new batch group.

3.  In the **Group** field, type a name for the batch group that is unique.

4.  In the **Description** field, type a value.

5.  In the **Scheduling priority** field, select the default scheduling priority
    for the batch jobs.

6.  Click **Save**.

Batch jobs
==========

A batch job is a group of tasks that are submitted for automatic processing.
Batch jobs are run by using the security credentials of the user selected as
**Run by** user. Use the following procedure to create a batch job.

Create a batch job
------------------

1.  Go to **Navigation pane \> Modules \> System administration \> Inquiries \>
    Batch jobs**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  In the **Job description** field, type a value.

4.  In the **Scheduled start date/time** field, enter a date and time.

5.  In the **Run by** field, select the users whose credentials will be used
    during execution. For more information, see [Batch manager security
    role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/sysadmin/runby).

6.  Optionally select **Monitoring category**, that can be used to easier
    identify types of jobs during monitoring.

7.  Optionally set **Critical job** field to Yes. For more information, see
    [Import users in
    bulk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/sysadmin/tasks/import-bulk-users)
    or [Configure the Workflow message processing batch job as
    critical](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/workflow-batch-job-critical).

8.  In the **Batch group** field, select the batch group for the job.

9.  Optionally set **Scheduling priority is overridden** to Yes, to enable the
    **Job scheduling priority** field.

10. In the **Job scheduling priority** field, select a different default
    priority than used for the Batch Group.

11. In the **Active period** field, optionally select a time range for when the
    batch job can be executed. For more information see [Active batch
    periods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/sysadmin/activeperiod).

12. Click **Save**.

Add a task to a batch job
-------------------------

1.  In the **Batch job** form, go to the **Batch tasks** section and click New.

2.  In the **Task description** field, type a value.

3.  In the **Company accounts** field, select the company in which the task will
    run.

4.  In the **Class name** field, select the applicable process to be executed.

5.  Click **Save**.

6.  Expand the **Batch task detail** section to add additional settings for the
    batch task or to add constraints:

7.  Go to the **General** tab to add additional settings for the task.

8.  Set **Ignore task failure** to Yes, if the failure of the task should not
    cause the job to fail.

9.  In the **Maximum retries** field to specify the number of times that a task
    should be retried before it is considered to have failed.

10. Set the **Private** field to Yes, if the task should only be run by the user
    who created the job. Only applicable for client tasks.

11. Go to the **Constraints tab** and click **New** to define constraint between
    tasks.

12. In the **Task ID** field, select the preceding task.

13. In the **Expected status** field, select the status that the preceding task
    must reach before the current task can run.

14. Click **Save**.

>   If you enter more than one condition, and if all conditions must be met
>   before the dependent task can run, select a condition type of **All**.
>   Select a condition type of **Any** if the dependent task can run after any
>   of the conditions has been met.
