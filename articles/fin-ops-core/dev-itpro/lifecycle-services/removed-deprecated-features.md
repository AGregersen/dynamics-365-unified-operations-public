### Flowchart diagrams in Business process modeler

|   |  |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Reason for deprecation/removal** | We are deprecating the flowchart diagrams component in Business process modeler (BPM) due to the legacy design that results in low usage.  |
| **Replaced by another feature?**   | No |
| **Areas affected**                 | Business process modeler |
| **Status**                         | Deprecated: The flowchart diagrams feature in BPM is expected to be removed by early February 2020. The following functionality will be removed:<br><br>- Existing flowcharts will be unavailable for viewing or editing, and the shape properties associated with flowchart activities will also be unavailable because the entire Flowchart tab will be removed.  These flowcharts include the default flowcharts that are automatically generated and customized flowcharts that are modified based on those default flowcharts.<br>- The legacy fit/gap analysis feature will be unavailable. Therefore, no gap list will be automatically created or available for export. Note: this feature had been deprecated and replaced by Azure DevOps integrations.<br>- Version history of the flowchart will be unavailable.
