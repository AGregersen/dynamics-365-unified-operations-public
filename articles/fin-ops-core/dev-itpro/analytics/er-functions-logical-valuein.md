[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The `VALUEIN` function determines whether the specified input matches any value of a given item in the specified list. Return a *Boolean* **TRUE** if the specified input matches the result of running the specified expression for at least one
record of the specified list. Otherwise, return a *Boolean* **FALSE**.


## Syntax

```
VALUEIN (input, list, list item expression)
```

## Arguments

`input` : *Field*

A valid path to an item of a data source of the *Record list* type. The value of this item will be matched.

`list` : *Record list*

A valid path to a data source of the *Record list* data type.

`list item expression` : *Boolean*

A valid conditional expression that either points to or contains a single field of the specified list that should be used for the matching.

## Returns

*Boolean*

The result *Boolean* value.

## Usage notes

In general, the `VALUEIN` function is translated to a set of **OR** conditions:

`
(input = list.item1.value) OR (input = list.item2.value) OR …
`

In some cases, it can be translated to a database SQL statement by using the `EXISTS JOIN` operator.

## Example 1

You define the following data source in your model mapping: **List** (*Calculated field* type). This data source contains the expression `SPLIT ("a,b,c", ",")`.

When a data source is called that is configured as the `VALUEIN ("B", List, List.Value)` expression, it returns **TRUE**. In this case, the `VALUEIN` function is translated to the following set of conditions: `(("B" = "a") or ("B" = "b") or ("B" = "c"))`, where `("B" = "b")` is equal to **TRUE**.

When a data source is called that is configured as the `VALUEIN ("B", List, LEFT(List.Value, 0))` expression, it returns **FALSE**. In this case, the `VALUEIN` function is translated to the following condition: `("B" = "")`, which isn't equal to **TRUE**.

Note that the upper limit for the number of characters in the text of such a condition is 32,768 characters. Therefore, you should not create data sources that might exceed this limit at runtime. If the limit is exceeded, the application will stop running, and an exception will be thrown. For example, this situation can occur if the data source is configured as `WHERE (List1, VALUEIN (List1.ID, List2, List2.ID)`, and the **List1** and **List2** lists contain a large volume of records.

In some cases, the `VALUEIN` function is translated to a database statement by using the `EXISTS JOIN` operator. This behavior occurs when the [FILTER](er-functions-list-filter.md) function is used and the following conditions are met:

- The **ASK FOR QUERY** option is turned off for the data source of the `VALUEIN` function that refers to the list of records. (No additional conditions will be applied to this data source at runtime.)
- No nested expressions are configured for the data source of the `VALUEIN` function that refers to the list of records.
- A list item of the `VALUEIN` function refers to a field (not an expression or a method) of the specified data source.

Consider using this option instead of the [WHERE](er-functions-list-where.md) function as described earlier in this example.

## Example 2

You define the following data sources in your model mapping:

- **In** (*Table records* type), which refers to the **Intrastat** table
- **Port** (*Table records* type), which refers to the **IntrastatPort** table

When a data source is called that is configured as the `FILTER (In, VALUEIN(In.Port, Port, Port.PortId)` expression, the following SQL statement is generated to return filtered records of the **Intrastat** table:

```
select … from Intrastat
exists join TableId from IntrastatPort
where IntrastatPort.PortId = Intrastat.Port
```

For **dataAreaId** fields, the final SQL statement is generated by the using **IN** operator.

## Example 3

You define the following data sources in your model mapping:

- **Le** (*Calculated field* type), which contains the expression `SPLIT ("DEMF,GBSI,USMF", ",")`
- **In** (*Table records* type), which refers to the **Intrastat** table and for which the **Cross-company** option is turned on

When a data source is called that is configured as the `FILTER (In, VALUEIN (In.dataAreaId, Le, Le.Value)` expression, the final SQL statement contains the following condition:

```
Intrastat.dataAreaId IN ('DEMF', 'GBSI', 'USMF')
```
