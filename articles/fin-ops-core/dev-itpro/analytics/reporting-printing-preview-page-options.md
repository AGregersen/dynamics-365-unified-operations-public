### Introduction
Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations now offers an expanded collection of user management options while previewing documents within the embedded PDF viewer.  This article describes the **Export** and **Network Printer** options now available for users.

## Overview
The efficient publication and distribution of documents is a key component to many functions which are critical to daily business activities.  Documents are used to capture transaction details and often represent an agreement between two parties.  From **Customer Quotations** to **Sales Invoices** through the **Sales Packing Slip** process ultimately producing **Customer Receipts** and **Statements**, business documents come in many forms. These preview options are being delivered to empower users to take the appropriate action with minimal distractions.

Nearly half of all document interactions involve the screen preview. The new toolbar options are available in all supported devices offering users a simple and intuitive solution for Exporting and Printing documents rendered by Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations applications.

### File export
Additional user options are being delivered to replace functions previously supplied by HTML-based Report Viewer control.  Use the new toolbar options to Export files to various formats supported by the service:  Word, Excel, HTML, CSV, and more.  To ensure a consistent layout with printer output, the new modern experience displays documents using the PDF pagination rules.  See [Pagination in reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/report-design/pagination-in-reporting-services-report-builder-and-ssrs?view=sql-server-ver15) for more information.

### Network printing
Users are now able to send documents directly to network printers in addition to being able to print on local devices using the print button.  With the new option, users may initiate print instructions to network connected printers while working remotely from a cellular device.

Use the toolbar option to choose the network printer and establish print settings.
