# Document reporting preview options

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

### Introduction
Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations now offers an expanded collection of user options while previewing documents within the embedded PDF viewer.  This article describes the **Export** and **Network Printer** options now available for users.

## Overview
The efficient publication and distribution of documents is a key component to many operations which are critical to daily business functions.  Documents are used to capture transaction details and may represent an agreement between two parties.  From **Quotations** to **Sales Invoices** through the **Packing Slip** process ultimately producing **Receipts** and **Customer Statements**, business documents come in many forms. These enhancements are being delivered to empower users to quickly take the appropriate action on documents rendered by the service.

Nearly half of all document interactions involve the screen preview. The new toolbar options are available in all supported devices offering users a simple and intuitive solution for **Exporting** and **Printing** documents rendered by Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations applications.

### File export
Additional user options are being delivered to replace functions previously supplied by HTML-based Report Viewer control.  Use the new toolbar options to Export files to various formats supported by the service:  Word, Excel, HTML, CSV, and more.  To ensure a consistent layout with printer output, the new modern experience displays documents using the PDF pagination rules.  See [Pagination in reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/report-design/pagination-in-reporting-services-report-builder-and-ssrs?view=sql-server-ver15) for more information.

### Network printing
Users may choose to print on locally connected devices using the print button or send documents directly to network printers using the new toolbar option.  Using the network print option, users may initiate print instructions to network connected printers while working remotely from nearly any internet connected device including mobile phones.

Use the toolbar option to choose the network printer and establish print settings.
