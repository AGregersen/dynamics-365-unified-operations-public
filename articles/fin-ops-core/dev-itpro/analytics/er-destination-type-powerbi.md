Set **Enabled** to **Yes** to use your ER configuration to arrange the transfer of data from your instance to Microsoft Power BI services. The transferred files are stored on a Microsoft SharePoint Server instance that must be configured for that purpose. For more information, see [Configure Electronic reporting (ER) to pull data into Power BI](general-electronic-reporting-report-configuration-get-data-powerbi.md).
