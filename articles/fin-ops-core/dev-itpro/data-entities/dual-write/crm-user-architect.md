Dual-write automates the data flow between Finance and Operations apps and Common Data Service. In the coming releaseses, concepts in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 like customer, contact, quotation, and order will scale to mid- and upper-mid market customers. 

In the first release, most of these changes are coming from dual-write solutions. In future releases, we will merge these solutions to the Common Data Service platform. We recommend that you understand dual-write and embrace it from start to avoid future surprises. Some of the crucial revisions are: 
+ Common Data Service has new concepts like company and party. These concepts will impact all applications built on Common Data Service, including Sales, Marketing, Customer Service, and Field Service. 
+ Activities and notes are unified and expanded to support both C1s (users of the system) and C2s (customers of the system). 
+ Changes in the Common Data Service platform include:
    - The decimal data type will replace the money data type.
    - Date effectivity will support past, present, and future data in the same place.
    - There will be more support for currency and exchange rates, including a revision of the **Exchange Rate** API.
    - Unit conversions will be supported.
