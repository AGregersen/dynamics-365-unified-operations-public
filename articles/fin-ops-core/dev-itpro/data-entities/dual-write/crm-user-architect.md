Dual-write automates the data flow between Finance and Operations apps and Common Data Service. In future releases, concepts in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 like customer, contact, quotation, and order will scale to mid- and upper-mid market customers. 

In the first release, most of the automation is handled by dual-write solutions. In future releases, these solutions will become part of the Common Data Service. Understanding the upcoming changes to the Common Data Service will save you effort in the long run. Some of the crucial revisions are: 
+ Common Data Service will have new concepts like company and party. These concepts will impact all applications built on Common Data Service, including Sales, Marketing, Customer Service, and Field Service. 
+ Activities and notes are unified and expanded to support both C1s (users of the system) and C2s (customers of the system). 
+ Upcoming changes in the Common Data Service include:
    - The decimal data type will replace the money data type.
    - Date effectivity will support past, present, and future data in the same place.
    - There will be more support for currency and exchange rates, including a revision of the **Exchange Rate** API.
    - Unit conversions will be supported.
