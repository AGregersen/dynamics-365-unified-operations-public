# Integrated vendor master

The term vendor refers to a supplier organization or a sole proprietor who supplies goods or services to the business. Vendor is an established concept in D365 Supply Chain. But Customer Engagement applications doesnâ€™t have an explicit vendor concept and so, Account/Contact entity is overloaded to store vendor information. With integrated vendor master, an explicit vendor concept  is introduced in customer engagement applications. Businesses can either choose the new vendor concept or use Account/Contact entity for vendors. Dual-write supports both these designs. Therefore, you can enable either of the designs, depending on your business scenario.
With both designs, the vendor data is integrated between Supply chain, Sales, Field Service and Power Portal applications and becomes available for Supply chain workflows like purchase requisition, purchase orders etc. 


### Vendor data flow

If you want to isolate the vendor information from Account or contact entities in Common Data Service, then you can use the *new vendor model*.

If you want to continue to use the Account and contact entity for storing vendor information, then you can use the extended vendor design. But for that you need to configure the vendor workflows coming from dual-write application orchestration solution package. See how to [switch between vendor designs](vendor-switching)

**Tip**

If you are using power portals for self-serving vendors, the vendor information can directly flow to Finance and operations applications. 

## Templates

Vendor data includes all information about the vendor, such as the vendor group, addresses, contact information, payment profile, and invoice profile. A collection of entity maps work together during vendor data interaction, as shown in the following table.
