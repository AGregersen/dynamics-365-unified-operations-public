# Top reasons for customers to embrace dual-write

Dual-write provides seamless process orchestration across Microsoft Dynamics 365 applications. This robust framework is linking together the environments and enables different business applications to work together. Here are the top reasons why customers should use dual-write: 

+ Dual-write provides a tightly coupled near-real-time and bi-directional integration between Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and model-driven applications. This tight integration makes Dynamics 365 the one-stop-shop for all your business problems. Customers using Microsoft solutions for finance and supply chain, but using non-Microsoft solutions for CRM are moving towards Dynamics 365 due to dual-write. 
+ Data from customers, products, operations, projects, and IoT are natively flowing to Common Data Service through dual-write, thus creating a Digital Feedback Loop. Such a connection is a boon to businesses that are interested in Power Platform expansions.
+ Dual-write infrastructure follows the no-code/low-code principle. Customers can extend the standard maps and include custom maps without engineering efforts.
+ Dual-write supports both online and offline modes, which is unique only to Microsoft. You cannot find it in any non-Microsoft ERP and CRM products.
