# Top reasons for customers to embrace dual-write

Dual-write provides seamless process orchestration across Microsoft Dynamics 365 applications. This robust framework links environments together and enables different business applications to work together. Here are the top reasons why you should use dual-write: 

+ Dual-write provides tightly-coupled, near-real-time, and bi-directional integration between Finance and Operations apps and model-driven applications in Dynamics 365. This integration makes Microsoft Dynamics 365 the one-stop-shop for all your business problems. Customers using Microsoft solutions for finance and supply chain, but using non-Microsoft solutions for CRM are moving towards Dynamics 365 due to dual-write. 
+ Data from customers, products, operations, projects, and IoT flows automatically to Common Data Service through dual-write. This connection is a boon to businesses that are interested in Power Platform expansions.
+ Dual-write infrastructure follows our no-code/low-code principle. You can extend the standard table-to-table maps and include custom maps with minimal engineering effort.
+ Dual-write supports both online and offline modes, which is unique only to Microsoft. You cannot find this support in non-Microsoft enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management products.
