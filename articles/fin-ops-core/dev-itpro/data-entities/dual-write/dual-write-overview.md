## What is dual-write?

Dual-write is an out-of-the-box infrastructure that provides near-real-time interaction between Microsoft Dynamics 365 model-driven applications and Finance and Operations applications. When data on customers, products, people, and operations flow beyond application boundaries, it empowers all departments in an organization.

Dual-write provides tightly-coupled, bi-directional integration between Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and the Common Data Service. Any data change in Finance and Operations apps results in writes to the Common Data Service and vice versa. This automated data flow provides an integrated user experience across the apps.

+ Ability to synchronize initial data between the applications.
+ Consolidated view of activity and error logs for data administrators.
+ Ability to configure custom alerts and thresholds, and subscribe to notifications.
+ Intuitive user-interface for filtering and transformations.
+ Ability to set and view entity dependencies and relationships.
+ Extensible for both standard and custom entities and maps.
