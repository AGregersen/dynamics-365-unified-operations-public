# Access to finance and tax reference data

Every business operates with a basic set of financial data like fiscal calendar year, currency to transact in, accounts from where 
the money to run the business comes in or goes out, tax rates and remittance, etc. This information resides in Dynamics 365 Finance 
but exposed to Common Data Service so that Dynamics 365 apps can run based on a single source for finance and tax data. This brings 
uniformity across the business eco-system. 
+ For more information about ledger data, see [Integrated ledger](ledger-mapping.md).
+ For more information about tax data, see [Integrated tax master](tax-mapping.md).
