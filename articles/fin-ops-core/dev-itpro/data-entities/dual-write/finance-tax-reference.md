# Access to finance and tax reference data

Every business operates with a basic set of financial data like fiscal calendar year, currency to transact in, accounts from where the money to run the business comes in or goes out, tax rates, and remittance. This information resides in Finance and Operations apps,
but exposed to Common Data Service so that model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 can run based on a single source for finance and tax data. This brings uniformity across the business ecosystem. 

Finance and tax data are integrating using these mappings:
+ [Integrated ledger](ledger-mapping.md).
+ [Integrated tax master](tax-mapping.md).
