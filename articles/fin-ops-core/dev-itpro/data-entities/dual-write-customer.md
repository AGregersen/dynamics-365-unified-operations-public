# Integrated customer master

[!include [preview](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

It's typical for customer records to be mastered in more than one application. For example, sales activity can bring in commercial customer records through a Sales application, and e-Commerce or retail sales can bring in customer records through a Finance and Operations application. Regardless of where the customer record originates, it's integrated behind the scenes across application boundaries and infrastructure differences. Integrated customer mastering helps handle multi-mastering scenarios and provides a comprehensive view of the customer to the Dynamics 365 application suite.

## Customer data flow

*Customer* is a well-defined concept in applications. Therefore, the integration of customer data just involves harmonizing the customer concept between the two applications. The following illustration shows the customer data flow.

![Customer data flow](media/dual-write-customer-data-flow.png)

Customers can be broadly classified into two types: commercial/organizational customers and consumers/end users. These two types of customers are stored and handled differently in Finance and Operations and Common Data Service.

In Finance and Operations, both commercial/organizational customers and consumers/end users are mastered in a single table that is named **CustTable** (CustomerCustomerV3Entity), and they are classified based on the **Type** attribute. (If **Type** is set to **Organization**, the customer is a commercial/organizational customer, and if **Type** is set to **Person**, the customer is a consumer/end user.) The primary contact person information is handled through the SMMContactPersonEntity entity.

In Common Data Service, commercial/organizational customers are mastered in the Account entity and are identified as customers when the **RelationshipType** attribute is set to **Customer**. Both consumers/end users and the contact person are represented by the Contact entity. To provide a clear separation between a consumer/end user and a contact person, the **Contact** entity has a Boolean flag that is named **Sellable**. When **Sellable** is **True**, the contact is a consumer/end user, and quotations and orders can be created for that contact. When **Sellable** is **False**, the contact is just a primary contact person of a customer.

When a non-sellable contact participates in a quotation or order process, **Sellable** is set to **True** to flag the contact as a sellable contact. A contact that has become a sellable contact remains a sellable contact.

## Templates

Customer data includes all information about the customer, such as the customer group, addresses, contact information, payment profile, invoice profile, and loyalty status. A collection of entity maps works together during customer data interaction, as shown in the following table.
