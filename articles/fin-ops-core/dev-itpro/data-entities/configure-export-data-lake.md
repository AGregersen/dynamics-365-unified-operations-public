Overview
--------

Configuring Export to Data lake has several steps.

You must create a storage account in your own Azure subscription and use a key
vault to provide that account to the system.

Next, you must create an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application ID that
grants access to the root of your storage account. The system will use the Azure
AD application to gain access to storage â€“ and create the folder structure and
write data.

Finally, you must create a key vault in your subscription, and provide
information about your storage account and the application to the Data Lake
offer in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).
