# Connect a custom help site

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Finance and Operations apps are rarely used out-of-the-box. Rather, the solution is customized and extended to fit the organization's needs. Similarly, you can customize and extend the Help experience, including adding custom Help to the in-product Help pane.  

Microsoft has provided a toolkit with sample code to help you deploy and connect custom Help to the Help pane. In [Deploying custom Help](../../dev-itpro/help/deploy.md), you can read about how you can set up a custom Help solution by publishing content as HTML to a website, make the content searchable, and extending the Help pane to connect to the website.
