# Workflow system

This topic answers frequently asked questions about the workflow system in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

## Notifications

### Why are multiple notifications received when a work item is rejected?
When a work item is rejected, that work item is completed as rejected. Another work item is created and assigned to the originator. This means that there is a notification to the originator for the rejected work item, and a separate notification to the user assigned to the new "change requested" work item. 

Each notification is for a different work item, but the similarity can cause confusion. We are looking at ways to improve this in a future release.

### Why are my workflow exports failing?
There is currently a limitation in the workflow export feature that prevents workflow names from exceeding 48 characters. Using a name that is longer than 48 characters can result in a "Server failed to authenticate the request" error and/or prevent a file to be exported  without a file type. The following blog post provides more details [Workflow Export Troubleshooting](https://community.dynamics.com/ax/b/elandaxdynamicsaxupgradesanddevelopment/archive/2019/04/10/workflow-export-troubleshooting).
