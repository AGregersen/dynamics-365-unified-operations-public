# Creating a Workflow Type 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To add workflow support for a document in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you must create a workflow type. This section describes the procedures to create a workflow type in Microsoft Dynamics AX. The workflow type can then be used to create workflow configurations for the document the Microsoft Dynamics AX.

You create workflow types to define:

  - The workflow document to assign the workflow to.

  - A category that defines the module that the workflow type is available in.

  - Tasks, automated tasks, and approvals supported for the workflow.

  - The workflow started, completed, configuration data change, and canceled event handlers.

  - A SubmitToWorkflowMenuItem.
