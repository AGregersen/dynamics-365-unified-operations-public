This topic describes features that are new or changed in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations platform update 28. This version has a build number of 7.0.XXXX. For more information about Platform update 28, see [Additional resources](whats-new-platform-update-28.md#additional-resources).

## Data management enhanced view as the default view
The standard view in data management has been deprecated for about a couple of years. Users going to the data management workspace were informed about the deprecation during this period. The enhanced view is now being set as the default view as the next step towards this process. The standard view is still available and can be brought back via the existing setting in framework parameters, although it is not recommended to use standard view as it will be deleted sometime in future. If users explicitly chose to use standard view by clicking the 'standard view' button on any of the data management forms, such users will continue to see standard view as thier personalized settings will be honoured. However, such users are also advised to switch to using enhanced view.

### Removed and deprecated features
The [Removed or deprecated features](../../dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md) topic describes features that have been removed or deprecated for Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features](../../dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/deprecated-features.md) topic 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
