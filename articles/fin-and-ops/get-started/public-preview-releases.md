# Standard and targeted service updates

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

With Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, you receive new service updates and features monthly instead of doing expensive upgrades every few years. You can manage how your organization receives these updates. For example, you can sign up for an early release so that your organization receives updates first. You can designate that only certain environments receive the updates. Or, you can remain on the default release schedule and receive the updates later. This article explains the different release options and how you can use them for your organization.

Service updates will contain application (including financial reporting and Retail) and platform changes that are critical improvements to the service including regulatory updates. New experiences will be opt-in. 

## Release processes
Each new release is designed and developed by the Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations team. Any new release is first tested and validated by the feature team, then by the entire Dynamic 365 Finance and Operations and Retail team. During this time various test topologies are used.

The first release after development is complete is a **targeted release** (also known as **First release**). This release is available to customers who opt-in through the [insider program](https://experience.dynamics.com/). During this targeted release, Microsoft monitors telemetry, collects feedback and further validates quality by monitoring key metrics. There are two phases of the targeted release. In the first phase, partners and ISVs use the release to validate their customizations and provide feedback. 

The next release is targeted release for customers who opt in. After the targeted general availability, the new release is made available to all customers. This series of progressive validation is in place to make sure that the release is as robust as possible. The releases are shown in the following graphic.

### Standard release
The standard release is the default option. With this release you can access the most recent release of Finance and Operations when it is released to all Finance and Operations customers. In the standard release you configure the update date and time to ensure predictability. 

### Targeted release (First release) to CAAP
With a targeted release, Microsoft automatically deploys the latest service update to a specified Tier 2 sandbox. Continuous Auto-update Advantage Program (CAAP) participants can then work in the new environment while providing feedback directly to Microsoft. CAAP participants will receive direct support from Microsoft for any issues that are submitted. This is followed by applying the validated update to Production in a subsequent week.

### Targeted release (First release) to CEAP
A new program is available to just update a Tier 2 sandbox to the latest service update in the same timeframe. This has the additional value of testing updates early prior to updating the production environments.

### Service update experience
All service updates will have a similar experience of configure-> view -> update -> validate.
