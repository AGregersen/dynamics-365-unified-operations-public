## Return items across multiple customer orders and invoices

## Loyalty changes
Functionality has been added to enhance the loyalty features in Dynamics 365 for Retail.

For more information, see [Loyalty overview](../../retail/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md).

## Non-GST transaction for India 
This feature allows you to create non-GST transaction with the Tax engine. To create a non-GST transaction, you need to select the **Non-GST** check box in the **Tax information** of each taxable transaction line. You also need to make sure that there is a **Number sequence code** for **Bill of supply** in the **Reference number sequence group**. These transactions will be identified as non-GST transactions in the GST return (GSTR). 

## Fiscal printer integration sample for Poland
Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail now contains a sample of the integration of POS with fiscal printers for Poland. The sample is a part of the Retail SDK. Implementation partners may extend the integration functionality to cover all required retail scenarios or build integration with other fiscal printer models based on the samples.

## Tax functionality updates for China

In China, official tax invoices can only be issued via two government-authorized invoicing software (Aisino and BaiWang). This feature lets you export the issued invoices into the .TXT and .XML file formats so you can import the files into the authorized invoicing software of Aisino and BaiWang providers accordingly. 

You can also maintain the tax classification and codes in Finance and Operations, which is in alignment with tax integration interface 3.0. The exported invoice file will include commodity codes (classification of goods and services) which is mandatory for China. 

The standard category hierarchy setting functionality is used to include the commodity codes in the invoice lines of the exported file.

The following updates are included in this release:

- There is a new interface with BaiWang provider software that lets you export issued invoices in .XML format and you can import files from BaiWang software in .TXT and .XML formats.
- We updated the structure of the issued invoice that is exported and you can import .TXT file for interface with Aisino provider software.
