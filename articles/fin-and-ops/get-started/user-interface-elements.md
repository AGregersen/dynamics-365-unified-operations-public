# User Interface elements

This topic names and describes the UI (User Interface) components used in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. Before users can navigate the interface, it's necessary to know the elements that make up the interface.

## Overview

- **navigation bar**: The bar at the top of the interface. It contains the **Dynamics 365 portal**, **Search**, **company picker**, **action center**, **Settings**, **Help & Support**, and the user profile.  
- **navigation pane**: The left-most pane. From here, you can find any page in the product.  
- **filter pane**: On some pages, you can select **Show filters** to open this pane. It allows you to narrow the results visible to you on the page.  
- **navigation list**: On some pages, you can scroll through this pane to find a specific record. When selected, the details of the record will appear in the page.  
- **page**: The central focus of the interface. Selections made on the other UI components will affect what records are shown here.  
- **FactBox**: You can see information and follow the activities of certain records in this pane.  
- **FactBox pane**: Here, you can scroll through different aspects of a record to view in the FactBox.  
- **pane**: The right-most pane. This will open in some cases when aspects of a record need to be changed and saved.  
- **Action Pane**: The bar beneath the navigation bar. Here, you can find the tools and options necessary to change records shown in the page. You can **Edit** and **Save** the records here.  
- **tab**: A menu of options that appears when you select a given option in the Action Pane.  

The following image shows the placement of these elements on the interface.

## Tabs, fields, and sections

A *tab* is any selection made on the page that opens up a different aspect of record on the same page. Often, it will allow you to change certain *fields*, or UI elements that allow typed input. A *FastTab* is a tab with the added benefit of allowing multiple tabs to be visible at the same. You can expand a FastTab by selecting the downward-pointing arrow on the right end of it.

A *section* is similar to a tab. The word "section" is often used to describe any area of a page that organizes a specific category of information. Summary, Orders and favorites, and Links are all examples of sections.

The following images show examples of tabs, fields, and sections.

## Dialog boxes and drop-down menus

A *dialog box* is a pane that opens when certain selections are made to change or create a record. Dialog boxes contain fields that allow you to enter typed input. Sometimes, a given field will allow you to select a downward facing arrow that opens a list of options to choose from. This is called a *drop-down menu* or a *drop-down list*.

In some cases, a dialog box will open near a given button when you select it. This is called a *drop-down dialog box*.

The following images show examples of dialog boxes and drop-down menus.

## Notifications

Certain changes to the objects you oversee will appear as *notifications*. Notifications may tell you when a specific customer's information has been changed, or it may alert you when the system can't accept inputs you've added in certain fields. You can learn how to customize what you receive notifications about in the [Alerts overview](../get-started/alerts-overview.md).

Notifications appear in a variety of ways.
