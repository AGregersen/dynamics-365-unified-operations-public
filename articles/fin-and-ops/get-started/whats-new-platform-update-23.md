This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations platform update 23. This version has a build number of 7.0.XXXX.

### Dynamics 365 October '18 release notes
Wondering about upcoming and recently released capabilities in any of our business apps or platform? 

[Check out the October '18 release notes](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=870424). We've captured all the details, end to end, top to bottom, in a single document that you can use for planning. 

### Platform update 23 bug fixes
For information about the bug fixes included in each of the updates that are part of Platform update 23, sign in to Lifecycle Services (LCS) and view this [KB article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=) (**not yet available**).

## Legal entity filtering using grid column headers
Starting in Platform update 23, for grids with cross-company queries, users are able to filter the *Legal entity* column using the column drop-down menu, similar to other columns in the grid. For example, if a user is looking at the global transactions for a specific customer, he might want to find the transactions within a small subset of companies. Prior to this feature, he would have had to filter using the Customer range tab on the Advanced filter or sort dialog, or utilize page-specific custom filters.

## Export to Excel
In Platform update 22, the Export to Excel feature was improved to allow users to export up to 1 million rows from a grid in Finance and Operations, a substantial increase from the previous 10,000-row limit. 

In Platform udpate 23, we've continued to enhance this feature. After the export completes, users will now receive a notification in the Action center alerting them that the export has finished. The notification includes a link to download the Excel file containing the exported data. The link and notification are accessible for roughly three days after the export completes.
