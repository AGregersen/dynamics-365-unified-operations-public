# Trickle feed-based order creation for retail store transactions

In Dynamics 365 for Retail versions 10.0.4 and earlier <!--- check with Anil that this is correct versioning -->, retail statement posting is an end of day operation and all transactions are posted in the books at the end of the day. There is no processing of these transactions happening during the day and all of the transactions are back loaded. Large transactions must then be processed in a limited time window, sometimes resulting in load and locks and statement posting failures. Retailers also can't recognize revenue and payments in their books throughout the day

With trickle feed-based order creation introduced in version 10.0.5 <!--- check with Anil that this is correct versioning -->, transactions are processed throughout the day, and only the financial reconciliation of tenders and other cash management transactions are processed at the end of the day. This functionality splits the load of creating sales orders, invoices, and payments throughout the day, providing better perceived performance and the ability to recognize revenue and payments in the books in near real-time. 


# How to use trickle feed-based posting
  
1. To enable trickle feed-based posting of retail transactions, go to **System administration > Set up > License configuration** and disable the the **Retail statements** key.

2. On the same page, enable the **Retail statements (trickle feed) â€“ Preview** license key. When you enable this key, make sure there are no pending statements waiting to be posted. 

3. The current statement document will be split into two different types; transactional statement and financial statement.

      - The transactional statement will pick up all unposted and validated retail transactions and create sales orders, sales invoices, payment and discount journals, and income-expense transactions at the cadence that you configure. You should configure this process to run at a high frequency so that documents are created when the retail transactions are uploaded into headquarters (HQ) through the P-job. The **Post inventory** batch job should not be used with this feature.
   
     - The financial statement is designed to be created at the end of the day and only supports the closing method of shift. This statement will be limited to financial reconciliation and will only create the journals for the difference amounts between           counted amount and transaction amount for the different tenders, along with journals for other cash management transactions.   

<!--- this whole section needs to be validated/explained better by Anil -->
4. To calculate the transactional statement, click **Calculate transactional statements in batch**. To post the statements in batch,  use the **Post transactional statements in batch** option.

5. To calculate the financial statement, click **Calculate financial statements in batch**. To post the statements in batc, use the **Post financial statements in batch** option.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternately, both statement types can be created manually. Go to **Retail > Channels > Retail stores** and click **Retail statements**. Click **New** and then choose the type of statement that you want to create.
