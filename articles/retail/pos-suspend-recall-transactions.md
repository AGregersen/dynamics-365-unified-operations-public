# Suspend and resume transactions in the point of sale (POS)

POS users can suspend an in-progress transaction and resume it at a later time or on a different register.  This is typically done to quickly free up a register for a different task, without losing any progress on the current transaction.  For example, a store associate beings processing a customers transaction on a mobile device, but needs to complete it on register with a cash drawer.  The user would suspend the transaction on their register so it could be recalled and resumed on a different register.

## Configurating supsend/resume
Suspend and resume scenarios are enabled in POS by using two [POS operations](../pos-operations.md).
