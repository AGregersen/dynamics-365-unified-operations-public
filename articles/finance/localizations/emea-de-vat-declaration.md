**Note:** For sample forms of advance VAT returns that include declaration row
codes, see Forms in the VAT procedure for the year 2020.

Set up sales tax codes
======================

Set up sales tax codes by following the instructions in *Sales tax codes for VAT
reporting* and Sales tax overview.

**Note:** In a German legal entity, sales tax codes for tax-free sales should be
set up according to the following rules:

-   The tax rate is more than 0 (zero).

-   The tax code is marked as **Exempt** on the **Sales tax groups** page.

======================================

1.  In Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), in the **Shared asset
    library**, download the latest versions of the Electronic reporting (ER)
    configurations for the VAT declaration format:

-   **Elster (DE)**

>   For more information, see Download Electronic reporting configurations from
>   Lifecycle Services.

1.  Go to **Tax \> Setup \> Sales tax \> Electronic tax declaration setup**.

2.  In the **Format mapping** field, select the **Elster (DE)** format that you
    downloaded earlier.

3.  Go to **Tax \> Declarations \> Sales tax \> Report sales tax for settlement
    period**.

| Transaction date          | Enter the date when the sales tax report is calculated. The default value is the current date.

Submission the VAT declaration to ELSTER
========================================

ELSTER (Elektronische Steuererklรคrung, or electronic tax declaration) is a
German online tax office system that was designed by the Federal Central Tax
Office for online submission of tax declarations.

The Developers area of the ELSTER website provides examples that show how
developers can interact with ELSTER Rich Client (ERiC) for the submission of VAT
declarations in XML file format. Examples are provided for C++, C\#, and Java.
To access this area of the website, you must be registered as a developer. An
example might help you create your own executable file that you can use to
submit XML files via ERiC. To use an executable file to submit XML files to
ELSTER, you must download ERiC dynamics-link libraries (DLLs).

For more information about ERiC releases, see ELSTER website.

Example
=======

The following example shows how you can set up sales tax codes and sales tax
reporting codes, post transactions, and generate the German VAT declaration.

1.  Go to **Tax \> Indirect taxes \> Sales tax \> Sales tax codes**, and set up
    the following sales tax codes.

| **Sales tax code** | **Percentage** | **Description**                                                                       |
