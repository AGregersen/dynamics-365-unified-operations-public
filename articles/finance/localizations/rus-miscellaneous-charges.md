Miscellaneous charges can be allocated to the cost of goods, either works or
services, that are purchased or sold. Russian localization has two additional
methods to allocate charges:

-   **According to the gross weight** – Charges are allocated equally, according
    to the gross weight of the items that are received. This amount is equal to
    the quantity in the inventory transaction multiplied by the **Gross weight**
    field from the inventory item card.

-   **According to the volume** – Charges are allocated equally, according to
    the volume of the items that are received. This amount is equal to the
    quantity in the inventory transaction multiplied by the **Volume** field
    from the inventory item card.
