# DAS-2 report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

French legal entities doing business with self-employed professionals must provide the DAS-2 declaration report to the tax authorities. The DAS-2 report is an annual fiscal declaration that includes all payments greater than 1200 EUR to these type of vendors, and it should be generated in Microsoft Excel format. After the report is generated, save this file in the **ETAFI (CEGID)** environment. The file will then be validated and converted into to EDI structure and then transmitted.   

The DAS-2 Excel report is generated by using by using the Electronic reporting tool and include the following sheets:

- **Details:** All vendor invoices paid by the select period and vendor profile with DAS-2 classification.
- **Summary by vendor:** This is the DAS-2 declaration grouped by vendor where each column represents the amounts per DAS-2 classification.
- **DAS-2 form:** A summary of declaration for each vendor. One form per vendor.

Before you generate the report for the first time, you need to download the following models and formats from LCS. 

- Statistics on invoices.version.32.xml or higher versions 
- Statistics on invoices model mapping.version.32.31.xml or higher versions
- DAS-2 report.version.32.14 (FR) or a higher versions
- DAS-2 form.version.32.14.6 (FR) or a higher versionsÂ 

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about how to download ER format, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md). 
	

After you've finished downloading the ER configurations from LCS, complete the following steps.

1. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, select the related French company.
2. Go to **Workspaces** > **Electronic reporting**, and set the Microsoft provider to **Active**.
3. Select **Configurations** > **Exchange**, and load the configuration from the XML file to import the tax declaration model and GST report format file.
4. In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, select **Configurations** > **Setup.**
5. On the **Conditions** tab, select version **32.14**, and create the configuration that will let you set up the mapping between main accounts that are configured in your company, and the related tax authority classification of the DAS-2 report.

	1. In the **Lookup result** field, select the related classification.
	2. In the **Main account** field, select the main account used to post the related transactions that belongs to this classification.
	3. Set the **Status** parameter to **Completed**.

### Example

[![Example of cofiguration](./media/emea-fra-das2-report-configuration.png)](./media/emea-fra-das2-report-configuration.png)

In the above configuration line 2,  the main account 622600 that is used to post fee expense transactions is mapped with the classification **H : Fees and Vacations** as established by the tax authority. 

The line 1 includes the configuration with the classification **ZZ** and is used when the invoice journal has other expense transactions that will not be detailed in DAS-2 report. Create additional lines for each VAT main account and DAS2 classification when the invoice has tax amounts included in the transactions. 

> [!NOTE]
> Create the same configuration for the DAS-2 page.

## Assign a tax registration ID to a vendor record
Because the report includes the SIRET registration, the tax registration ID that represents the SIRET uses the registration category, **VAT ID**. Complete the following steps to add a tax registration ID to a vendor record.

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Global address book** > **Registration types** > **Registration types** and create the SIRET registration type.
2. Go to **Organization administration** > **Global address book** > **Registration types** > **Registration categories** to assign registration type **SIRET** to the category, **VAT ID**.
3. Go to **Accounts payable** > **Vendors** > **All vendors** .
4. Find and open the vendor record that you want to enter the registration ID for.
5. On the **Vendor** page, select **Registration ID** to open the **Manage addresses** page. 
6. On the **Tax registration** tab, select **Add**, and enter in the **Registration ID** field, select **SIRET**.
		

## Generate the DAS2 report 
The tax declaration report is generated by using the following steps.

1. Go to **Accounts payable** > **Inquires and reports** > **DAS-2 report**.
2. Select the format for the report: 

	- **DAS-2 report (FR)**: Generate a detailed report with all transactions
	- **DAS-2 form (FR)** Generate a separate report for each vendor
	
3. Select the from and to dates.
4. Select the vendor posting profile. These profiles enable you to group all vendors, a group of vendors, or a single vendor with the purpose of including vendors transactions in the generated report. You can create a specific posting profile to be used in these reports.

> [!NOTE]
> The DAS2 report includes all purchase invoices that are fully settled in the period selected and the vendor profile. Invoices with partial settlement are not included in this report.
