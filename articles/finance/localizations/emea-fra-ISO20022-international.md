This topic provides information about how to set the ISO20022 (FR) (pain.001) payment format to support cross border payments outside of SEPA area, treasury transfers, and payments in currencies different from EUR.


## Prerequisites

Before you can set the ISO20022 payment format, you need to import the most recent versions of the following Electronic reporting configuration from LCS:

- ISO20022 Credit transfer (FR): All required model and model mapping configurations will be imported automatically with this.
