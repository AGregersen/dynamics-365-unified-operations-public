[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

According to R.D. 596/2016 in Spain, a new value-added tax (VAT) management
system that is based on the Immediate Supply of Information on VAT (Suministro
Inmediato de Información del IVA [SII]) allows for a two-way, automated
relationship between the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) and the taxpayer. In the rest
of this topic, this system will be referred to as the SII system. Starting July
1, 2017, taxpayers who are subject to SII, and those who voluntarily adopt it,
must send details of their billing records within four days through online
filing on the AEAT website.

For more information about the SII system of Spain, see the [Immediate Supply of
Information on VAT (SII) official
