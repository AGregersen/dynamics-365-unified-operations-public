title: Declaration 347 report
---

This topic provides information about how to generate the Declaration 347 report
that is available to legal entities that have their primary address in Spain.

The Declaration 347 report must be electronically submitted to the tax
authorities every year, during the first 20 days of March. It must include all
the information from the previous fiscal year (January through December). All
transactions over 3,000 euros must be included. Additionally, cash payment
amounts that exceed 6,000 euros in a year must be included. Amounts are split
per quarter over the year.

You can use the **Declaration 347** page to generate the Declaration 347 report.
All invoices are grouped either by tax exempt number and customer/vendor number,
or only by tax exempt number. The resulting aggregated line is included on the
**Declaration 347** page if the total amount of invoices on the line exceeds the
value of the **Minimum amount** field that is set in the **Declaration 347**
dialog box. If some invoices are paid in cash, and the total amount of cash
payments for invoices on the line exceeds the value of the **Minimum amount of
payments in cash** field in the **Declaration 347** dialog box, this amount will
be shown in the **Amounts in cash** field of the declaration.
