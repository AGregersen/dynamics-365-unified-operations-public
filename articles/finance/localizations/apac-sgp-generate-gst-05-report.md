[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains the functionality for generating Singapore GST-05 reports. The GST-05 report is used to file a goods and services tax (GST) return. 

Singapore companies must file a goods and services tax (GST) return (GST-05) on a regular basis. The GST-05 report includes breakdown details such as standard-rated, zero-rated, and exempt purchases and sales in a regulated format. To accommodate the requirements, you must complete the following two operations while you complete the tax settlement process:

-   Categorize your tax codes into three categories by selecting proper value for the **VAT type** field on the **Sales tax codes** page:
    -   Standard
    -   Zero
    -   Exempt
-   On the sales tax authority page, specify the dedicated **Singapore report layout** reporting format.

When you settle and post sales tax to process a tax settlement, the GST-05 report will be generated and printed.
