# Generate the Singapore GST-05 report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains the functionality for generating Singapore GST-05 reports. The GST-05 report is used to file a goods and services tax (GST) return. 

Singapore companies must file a goods and services tax (GST) return (GST-05) on a regular basis. The GST-05 report includes breakdown details such as standard-rated, zero-rated, and exempt purchases and sales in a regulated format. To accommodate the requirements, you must complete the following two operations while you complete the tax settlement process:

-   Categorize your tax codes into three categories by selecting proper value for the **VAT type** field on the **Sales tax codes** page:
    -   Standard
    -   Zero
    -   Exempt
-   On the sales tax authority page, specify the dedicated **Singapore report layout** reporting format.

When you settle and post sales tax to process a tax settlement, the GST-05 report will be generated and printed.


## Generate GST-05 report by using the electronic reporting tool

You can generate the GST-05 report by using the electronic reporting tool. The released version of the report will also include the changes introduced in 2020. These changes include:

- Box 11: Reverse charge transactions.
- Box 14: Amounts of imported services that are subject to GST. The same amount should also be included in the total value of standard-rated supplies as reported in Box 1.
- Box 15: Amounts of digital services that are subject to GST. The same amount should also be included in the value of standard-rated supplies as reported in Box 1.

Before you generate the report for the first time, download the following models and formats from LCS. 

-  Tax declaration model.version.32.xml or higher versions
-  Tax declaration model mapping.version.32.37.xml or higher versions
-  GST Report version 32.1 (SG) or a higher versions

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about how to download ER format instructions, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs.md)

Complete the following steps after you download the ER configurations from LCS shared asset library.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, select the related SG company.
2. Go to **Workspaces** > **Electronic reporting** and set the Microsoft provider to **Active**.
3. Select **Configurations** > **Exchange** and load from the XML file to import the tax declaration model and GST report format file.
4. Go to the **Electronic reporting** workspace, and select **Configurations** > **Setup**.
5. On the **Conditions** tab, select **version 32.1**, and create the configuration that will allow you to set up the mapping between the sales tax code configured in your company and the related boxes of GST-05 report.

	1. In the **Lookup result** column, select the related box.
	2. In the **Tax code (Code)** column, select the sales tax code used to calculate the related box.
	3. In the **Name** column, select the appropriate operation where this tax is used.

6. Set the parameter status to **Completed**.
		
**Example**

In the GST-05 declaration report, Box 1 refers to the value of the supplies which are subject to GST at the standard rate of 7%. The value you enter in this box should not include the charged GST amount.
Suppose you created the sales code to support the standard rate of GST_7% in sales, you then need to create entries under **Conditions** tab.

> [!NOTE]
>  To avoid issues when generating the report, create all mappings where the sales tax codes are posted. For example, if the line with SalesCreditNote is omitted in this configuration and there are tax transactions posted with sales tax code GST_7% , then there will be issues when the report is generated.  We recommend that you use the Posted sales tax inquire in order to check all sales tax codes that are posted and not included in this mapping of configuration.  
	
### GST report generation
The tax declaration report is generated by completing the following steps:

1. Go to **Tax** > **Declarations** > **Sales tax** > **GST tax report**. 
2. Select the format mapping, **GST report**.
3. Select **From** and **To** dates.
4. Select the **Settlement period** and tax declaration **Version**.
	
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to execute the sales tax settlement process to generate the related tax payment.
