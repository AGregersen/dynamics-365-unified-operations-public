# Advanced notes management

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This functionality allows users to set up predefined notes applicable for all or specific customers, vendors and products and print these notes in specific business documents.
 
## Prerequisites

- The primary address of the legal entity must be in **Italy**.
- In **Feature management**, enable the feature **Advanced notes management**. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md)

## Advanced notes setup
### Customers and Vendors groups for advanced notes
In order to group customers to have similar notes printed in documents, you can define new groups specifically for advanced notes. 
Use **Accounts receivable** > **Setup** > **Avdanced notes** > **Customer advanced notes groups** to define groups codes and descriptions.

Once completed, assign the references to the created groups for the required customers in **Accounts receivable** > **Customers** > **All customers** > **Sales orders defaults** (FastTab) > **ADVANCED NOTES** (Section).
