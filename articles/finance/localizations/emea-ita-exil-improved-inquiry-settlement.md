- The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy.
- In the **Feature management** workspace, enable the **Improved inquiry on debit/credit settlement** feature. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Use Invoice/Payment list pages
To open the **Invoice/ Payments** list page go to: 

- **Account receivable > Customers > All customers, Inoice** tab > **Related information > Invoice/Payments**

    -OR-

- **Account payable > Vendors > All vendors, Inoice** tab > **Related information > Invoice/ Payments**

On the page, the top list  displays the customer and vendor invoices which are sorted by invoice number and date. 

The bottom list displays the debit and credit transactions of the selected customer or vendor. These transaction types include invoices, payment, and foreign currency revaluation transactions. Any non-zero balance in invoices is highlighted in red.
