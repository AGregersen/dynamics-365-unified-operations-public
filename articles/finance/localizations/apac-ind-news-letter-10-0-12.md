# What's new or changed for APAC India GST Localization in 10.0.12 (July 2020)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic includes a summary of the new features and critical bug fixes released in Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.12 for APAC India GST localization. 

## New features

### Improvements in unit price and cost price handling in stock transfer ordersâ€¯ 

This introduces the following improvements in the stock transfer order functionality: 

- Default **Transfer type** and **Price type** values can be configured in the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters**. 
- The unit price on a stock transfer order line is correctly recalculated based on the inventory dimensions specified in the line until the first shipment is posted for the line. 
- The shipment of a stock transfer order line with a unit price of zero (0) can be prevented. 
- Correct inventory costs are posted for stock transfer orders in case of partial shipment or receipts or batch-controlled items. 
- Unrealized profit or loss is not posted during the shipment or receipt of a stock transfer line if the unit price differs from the inventory cost price of the item. 
- Changing the unit of measure on stock a transfer order line is restricted. 

This feature can be enabled through Feature management.

## Critical fixes 

- A stock transfer has the same tax rate applicability at the time of shipment and receipt, including partial receipt. This means that tax was calculated on the new HSN code percentage instead of on the transfer order before the change in the HSN code percentage, which caused revenue loss to the customer.    
- Tax information fields were not updated automatically when copied from the original free text invoice. After this fix, the system updates the tax information related fields in the free text invoice lines that were copied from the original invoice line after tax. The tax document now displays the correct tax amount.   
- When the Invoice Journal was posted with TDS, users would reverse the one transaction line from the **Vendor transaction** page and adjust the withholding tax through 
  the General journal. Then, when the withholding tax payment was run, an error would occur. This was happening because because the vendor invoice journal with 
  TDS was not getting the ledger account through the table **TaxWHTransGeneralJournalAccountEntry**.
- In a multi-line invoice journal, when the transaction date is modified, only the first line in the tax document is updated with the corrected date when all of the lines must be updated with the latest transaction date.  
- When we try to post the general journal entry by using **Account type as project** and **Offset account type as a vendor** with the load on inventory and a reverse 
  charge percentage of 100%, the system doesnt allow the entry to and the following error occurs, **The transaction on voucher INMF-00545 do not balance as  per 3/25/2020 (Accounting currency: -2500, Reporting currency: -2500).** After this fix, posting the Project entry with the load on inventory and reverse charge percentage from the General journal system will allow posting without any imbalance error.  
- Removed and inactive addresses are appearing under the **Location** field on the **Tax information** page for invoices that are generated through the **Invoice journal** and the **Free text invoice**. After this fix, the removed and inactive addresses will not appear under the **Location** field.  
- Lookup condition is linked to two different component measure owners.
- Voucher details are not showing in the posted journal during the process of settling the post-dated check. With this fix, the line shows on the grid.  
- An error occurs when posting an invoice journal that has multiple lines with TDS where the exchange rate changed after creating lines in the invoice journal. 
  With this fix, the system posts the invoice journal (multiline) transaction successfully including TDS where the exchange rate is changed after all the lines are created in the invoice journal. The system will pick the latest defined exchange rate for the whole transaction.  
- The WHT tax group is not editable during invoice processing in India Legal Entity when a transaction is posted through the **Pending invoice** page. With this fix, the TDS/TCS group will be editable on the **Purchase order pending invoice** page for the line. You will be able to update the TDS/ TCS related fields in the **Pending invoice** page during invoicing.  
- The source details in the **GST** number sequence group were able to be deleted. With this fix, you can't delete the source details in the **GST reference** number sequence group if they are attached to a transaction. If you does not attach the source details to the transaction, you can delete the source details and then add them again.  
- Charges are not automaically updated in the **Assessable value** field on the sales order line when charges are applied through the **Auto charges** functionality even when the **Assessable value** check box is selected during setup. Charges are not auto-updating on the sales order line to include the charge amount in the assessable value of goods. After this fix, charges will be auto-updated on the sales order line when the **Assessable value** check box in marked and it will be part of the assessable value for tax calculation.  
- Importing general journal lines with tax by using the data import-export feature completed successfully. However, when the tax document is was verified, all of the tax information from the imported general journal transaction was missing. To fix this issue, updates were made to the data entity, **Ledger journal line transaction tax information**.  
- When a balancing financial dimension is updated in the ledger and the financial dimension is not set in the authority vendor, the following error occurred, **The transactions on voucher xxx do not balance as per xxx**. This message is misleading. With this fix, when the balancing the financial dimension is updated on the **Ledger** page, an error message will appear to check whether the financial dimension is set in the authorized vendor.   
- When you create a new customer, the system writes a record, **TaxInformationCustTable_IN** with **TaxInformationCustTable_IN.CustTable=''**, and then updates it with the customer account number. When the second step is canceled by exception, the first step will not roll back and the record is still there. When you try to create the customer record again, you can't because the column, **TaxInformationCustTable_IN.CustTable** is a unique index of the table. The system shouldn't save the record wit **TaxInformationCustTable_IN.CustTable=''**. After this fix, when the **CustTable** field exists, records can be inserted into the related table.  
- Bill of entry (BOE) assessable value is not updating per the assessable value on the purchase order line. After this fix, when a user creates new BOE after the cancellation
  of earlier one, the new BOE will display the updated assessable value of the import order line.  
- Importing data by using the data entity **Ledger journal line transaction tax information** results in the following two errors:  

    - Matching record with key 'Registration Number': 29AGNPB4831B1Z1 for the data source 'GSTIN' does not exist  
    - Update not allowed for field **TransTaxInformationEntity.TaxWithholdNatureOfAssessee**. 
  
  The data entity, **Ledger journal line transaction tax information** was updated to resolve this.   

  
## Upcoming fixes in 10.0.13

- In an intercompany transaction, when a sales order is posted in one company, a purchase order is automatically generated in another company. However, the tax information based on the location of the purchasing company is not defaulting correctly in the auto-generated purchase order. After this fix, the generated purchase order tax location of the purchasing company will default based on the warehouse information attached to the purchase order.
- When a withholding tax transaction is posted in a foreign currency, at the time of the withholding tax settlement to the authority, an imbalance error will occur. After this fix is implemented, you will able to successfully run settlements to the authority. After the line details are updated, the withholding tax (TCS) is calculated correctly for intercompany purchase return orders.
- When you import data by using the data entity, **Ledger journal line transaction tax information**, the following error occurs: **Results: Matching record with key tax information" to resolve the issue**.
- Vendor tax information is imported through the **Data entity** page. The system allows you to select more than one set of primary tax information details for vendor tax information. After this is fixed, the system will only allow you to enable one set of primary tax information details for the same vendor.
- Vendor tax information is imported through data entity form then on refreshing data. The system is allowing the user to select more than one primary tax information 
  details in vendor tax information. After this fixed system will restrict the user to enable more than one primary tax information details for the same vendor.
- When a customer is trying to do import purchase order the value of IGST tax is not getting displayed in the Totals tab after doing purchase order totals and 
  purchase order invoice. After this fixed value of IGST tax will display in Totals tab in purchase order and purchase order invoice. However, the user has to
  enable checkbox in parameter to enable this option.
- Field transaction type should be disabled in the sales quotation form. User can manually add and update the field transaction type in the sales quotation form.
  If it is updated to value except None or Expense, the Customer tax information will be invisible. Through this fix, the field Transaction type will only available for
- While posting foreign vendor payment and applied the withholding tax of Non-Residence. If the user changes currency rates on transaction, a similar exchange rate
  not applied for withholding tax calculation. instead, it is taking from the system. Due to this, there is an imbalance in posting and stopped posting the transaction.  
  With this fix vendor payment with TDS in foreign currency, the transaction will post successfully.
- The system is not showing the tax-adjusted amount at the time of bill of entry to tax document form of the invoice posting form. After this fixed system axe 
  amount adjusted in Bill of entry form will flow and display in tax document of posting Invoice form.
  
- The **Bill of entry** (BOE) number column is present on the **Product receipt** page, but it is not being displayed After this fix, the BOE number will show by default in the lines on the **Product receipt** page.
- The load on inventory tax amount is posted to the purchase expenditure for an expense account instead of the cost of project account/fixed asset account when a purchase order 
  placed with a procurement category (Transaction posted with Project -vendor or fixed asset â€“ vendor combination ). After this fix, the tax amount will load to an offset account.
- After you post an imported purchase order, the system still allows you to create an invoice by selecting **Products receipt** on the **Pending vendor invoice** page. 
  With this fix, after the imported purchase order invoice is posted, it will not be available on the **Pending vendor invoice** page when you select **Product receipt**.
