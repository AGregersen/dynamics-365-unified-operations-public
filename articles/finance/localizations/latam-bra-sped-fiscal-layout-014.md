# SPED fiscal ICMS-IPI Layout 014 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This topic provides information about how to set up and generate the Sped fiscal statement layout 014 which is applicable as of January 2020 under the practical guide, **EFD-ICMS/IPI â€“ version 3.0.3**.

To view the new layout, go to **Fiscal books** > **Setup** > **Tax statements parameters** > **Sped fiscal** > **Sped fiscal parameters** > **Layout version**.

## Record 0002: Classification of fiscal establishment

This record is generated when the field **IND_ATIV** of record 0000 is equal to "0" and the classification of the fiscal establishment is configured and assigned. This can be completed by going to **Fiscal books** > **Setup** > **Tax statements parameters** > **Sped fiscal** > **Sped fiscal parameters** > **Classification**. 

The classification is assigned to the related fiscal establishment. When more than one type of classification applies, select the classification that is most relevant in the establishment.

## Record C500: Incoming fiscal documents
This record is generated for Incoming fiscal document models, 6, 66, 29, and 28. The following new fields are included as part of new layout

| #  | Field        | Description                                                                                                                            |
|----|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 28 | CHV_DOCe     | Access key of the fiscal document then the fiscal document is equal to 66. Otherwise, the field is blank.                              |
| 29 | FIN_DOCe     | Fixed as one (1) only when a fiscal document is equal to 66. Otherwise, the field is blank.                                            |
| 30 | CHV_DOCe_REF | The access key for the referenced fiscal document if it exists when the fiscal document is equal to 66. Otherwise, the field is blank. |
| 31 | IND_DEST     | Fixed as one (1) because the fiscal establishment in the ICMS taxpayer.                                                                |
| 32 | COD_MUN_DEST | The IBGE code of the fiscal establishment.                                                                                             |

## Complement and compensation of ICMS-ST tax
The tax authority has introduced records C180, C185, 1010, and 1250 which detail the operations that are subject to ICMS-ST tax when the company applies the complement and compensation of ICMS-ST tax. Generating these records will be addressed by each state.


### Prerequisites

Before you enable generating these records, you must enable the presumed tax calculation. To do this, go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **Brazilian parameters** > **Fiscal document** and enable the following:
	
- ICMS- ST presumed tax
- ICMS-ST presumed tax in fiscal books 

To generate these records, complete the followign steps to set up the rule that will allow the records to be generated. The rule must be set up for each state.

1. Go to  **Fiscal books** > **Setup** > **Fiscal books parameters per state**.
2. Select the related state. For example, **SP**.
3. Enable record C180 and C185 as **Yes**. Records H030 with MOT_INV = 06 of record H005 and 1010, 1250, 1255 are also generated. 
4. Select the method of calculation in **SPED presumed tax calculation algorithm**. The amounts calculated in the presumed tax process will be reported in record C185.

 ### Table 5.7 - Reason code table for complement and restitution

Table 5.7 represents the classification of complement and compensation of the ICMS-ST amounts. This table is implemented by each state and configured in **Fiscal books** > **Setup** > **Reason code for complement and restitution**.

![bra-sped-fiscal014-table57-setup](media/bra-sped-fiscal014-table57-setup.png)

After you complete the configuration of the reason code table, you need to set up the determination of reason code table 5.2 in **Fiscal books** > **Setup** > **Table 5.7 determination** by using the following criteria:

- Item code 
- CFOP code
- Taxation code

### Record C180
This new record introduces complementary information of incoming fiscal document models 01, 1B, 04. and 55 for transactions with the ICMS-ST tax transaction. This record is generated based on the following criteria:

- Fiscal books parameters per state, **Enable record C180 and C185** = Yes 
- Fiscal document tax transactions have taxation code = 10, 30, 60, 70
