# Statistics on payment practices report

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Businesses in UK in scope of reporting requirement must prepare and publish information about their payment practices and performance in relation to qualifying contracts, for each reporting period in the financial year. The information for each reporting period must reflect the policies and practices which have applied during that period, and the business's performance for that period.

The report must be published on a web-based service provided by or on behalf of the government within 30 days of the end of the reporting period.

In scope of report, there are some narrative descriptions of reporting practices as well as the following statistics:

- (1) The average number of days taken to make payments in the reporting period, from the date of receipt of invoice.
- (2) The percentage of payments made within the reporting period which were paid in 30 days or fewer, between 31 and 60 days, in 61 days or longer.
- (3) The percentage of payments due within the reporting period which were not paid within agreed terms.

## Report

The report **Statistics on payment practices (UK)** is available which is exported in Excel format and has two tabs:

- **Payments_made**: Contains statistics of types (1) and (2) above and details per vendor account. In the detailed view, it also contains details per payment made within a reporting period.
- **Payments_due**: Contains statistics of type (3) above and details per vendor account. In teh detailed view, it also contains details per invoice that are due within a reporting period.

You should download the latest version of ER configuration **Statistics on payment practices (UK)** along with **Statistics on invoices** (ER model) and **Statistics on invoices model mapping** (ER model mapping), before using this report.

Review fix downloading instructions in the topic [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs)

## Post documents and define the date of receiving the invoice.

Before generating the report, you should post invoices and payments and settle them properly. Not settled payments can't be exported in the Payments_made tab, since there is no information about invoice to be paid with this payment and number of days taken to make payments can't be calculated.

You can identify the date when purchase invoice was received and further use this date for calculating the number of days taken to make payments. Fill a new field **Receive document date** in the following pages:

When creating / posting the new **Vendor invoice**, you can define **Receive document date** on the **Vendor invoice** page, in the **Vendor invoice header** tab, **Invoice dates** group of fields. The value is pre-defaulted from the **Invoice date** field.

When creating **Vendor invoice journal** line, you can define **Receive document date** on the **General** tab.

Also, you can fill the **Receive document date** after the vendor invoice is posted and before itâ€™s fully settled, on **Vendor transactions** page, on the **General** tab.
