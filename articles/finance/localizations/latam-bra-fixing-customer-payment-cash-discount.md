# Enable customer payments and cash discounts

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you create a Customer payment journal in a legal entity that is configured for Brazil, and the payment date grants cash discounts, if the date of payment in the payment journal is changed to another date where discounts are no longer applicablee, the payment journal continues to calculate cash discounts.
This alteration fixes the algorithm for calculation of cash discounts to grant cash discounts within the proper range of the dates, according to the setup of Payment methods.‚Äù

Currently, the Customer payment journal does not remove the cash discount from the settlement amount when the payment date changes. YOu can enable the Customer payment journal to recalculate the settlement amount and remove the cash discount if the payment date changes and it becomes out of date.
