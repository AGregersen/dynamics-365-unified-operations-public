# Expense receipt processing

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Expense entry has been enhanced through the introduction of **Receipt OCR** processing, designed to improve the end user experience when creating expense reports.

## Key features include:

- Extracts Merchant name, Date, and Total amount from the receipt
- Attempts to match unattached receipts to an unattached expense transaction
- Allows the user to create a manually entered expense transactions from the receipt

## Usage examples

1. **Auto attaching receipts with credit card transactions during the creation of an expense report**
   - Open the **Expense management** workspace
   - Verify that unattached receipts exist by selecting the **Receipts** tab. Receipts can also be uploaded from the **Receipts** tab.
   - Verify that unattached expenses exist by selecting the **Expenses** tab. Typically these are imported in from our credit card provider by the Expense administrator.
   - Select **New expense report**, note th new capability of adding *Expenses* and *Receipts* during the new expense creation form.
   - Adding both receipts and expenses will trigger the automatically matching of the receipts against the expenses.
   
2. **Create an expense or match an expense from a receipt**
