# Credit and collections overview

This app provides capability to manage credit limits for your customers and to engage in collection activities when those actions become necessary. 

## Credit management

Customer credit management allows you to manage credit limits and control the flow of sales orders through the posting process based on credit rules that you create.

The process for using credit management can include any of the following steps:

-	Update customers with credit attributes that provide additional information about their credit worthiness
-	Create credit limits for customers using credit limit adjustments
-	Create temporary credit limits for customers using credit limit adjustments when you want to increase or decrease their credit limit temporarily based on business needs
-	Add additional information that can affect the credit limit such as insurance and guarantees
-	Create customer credit groups that link customers together so they can share a single credit limit
-	Assign risk scores to customers and then use those scores to automatically generate credit limits for customers using credit limit adjustments
-	Create blocking rules that will place an order on hold during one or more posting processes based on factors such as risk, payment terms, credit limits, overdue amounts, and percentage of credit limit used
-	Manage a list of sales orders that are on hold, review the reasons for the hold, and mitigate the issues
-	Release sales orders and allow it to continue through the posting process
-	Set up workflow to manage the approval of credit limit changes and sales order releases

## Collections management

Accounts receivable collections information is managed in one central view using the **Collections** page. Collections managers can use this central view to manage collections. Collections agents can begin the collections process from customer lists that are generated by using predefined collection criteria, or from the **Customers** page.

Before you begin to set up or work with collections, you should understand the following concepts:

-	Customer aging snapshots contain aged balance information at a point in time
-	Collections customer pools help you organize your work
-	Collections agents can have their own customer pools
-	List pages organize collections customers, activities, and cases
-	All collections information for a customer is on one page and you can take action from that page
-	Waiving, reinstating, or reversing interest and fees can be done in one step
-	Creating write-off transactions can be done in one step
-	Processing not sufficient funds (NSF) payments can be done in one step

These concepts are described more completely in the [Collections management key concepts](./cm-collections-concepts.md) topic.
