# Customer credit management overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Customer credit management allows you to manage credit limits and control the flow of sales orders through the posting process based on credit rules that you create. 

The process for using credit management can include some or all of the following steps:
- Create credit limits for customers using credit limit adjustments
- Create temporary credit limits for customers using credit limit adjustments when you want to increase or decrease their credit limit temporarily based on business needs
- Add additional information that can affect the credit limit such as insurance and guarantees
- Create customer credit groups that link customers together so they can share a single credit limit
- Assign risk scores to customers and then use those scores to automatically generate credit limits for customers using credit limit adjustments
- Create blocking rules that will place an order on hold during one or more posting processes based on factors such as risk, payment terms, credit limits, overdue amounts, and percentage of credit limit used
- Manage a queue of sales orders that are on hold, review the reasons for the hold, and mitigate the issues
- Release the order and allow it to continue through the posting process
- Set up workflow to manage the approval of credit limit changes and sales order releases
