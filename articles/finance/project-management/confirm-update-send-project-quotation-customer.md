# Confirm, update, and send a project quotation to customer

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

After you create a project quotation, you can get confirmation from the customer before you update the quotation status to **Send**. Any modifications requested by the customer can be updated in the quotation. After you update the quotation status to **Send**, you can’t modify it. The following procedure describes options to send a quotation for confirmation, make updates based on feedback, and then send the quotation to the customer.

## Send a project quotation to customer for confirmation  

You can send an existing project quotation for confirmation through email or as a printed copy. 

1. Go to **Project management and accounting** > **Quotations** > **Project quotation.** 
2. From the **Project quotation** page, select the quotation you want to send for confirmation. 
3. On the **Follow up** tab, in the **Generate** group, select **Confirm**. 
4. On the **Confirm quotation** page, set the required parameters. For example, to print the confirmation, under **Print** options, turn on **Print confirmation**, and then select **OK**.
5. From the **Send quotation** page, select **Options**, and then in the **Print destination settings** page, select whether you want the quotation sent to **Screen**, **E-mail**, **File**, **Print archive** or **Printer**, and then make any adjustments that you want in the **Specification** area to route the quotation.
6. Select **OK** in the **Print destination settings** page.
