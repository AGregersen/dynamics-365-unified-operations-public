# Overview
Financial reporting has a wide variety of features in order to support complex currency reporting requirements. Financial reporting can report on any of the following currency amounts:
* Accounting currency amount 
* Reporting currency amount 
* Transaction currency amount 
* Translate to any currency setup within Dynamics 365 for Finance

## Filtering by currency
By default all report amounts are summarized and presented in the accounting currency of that company. If you need to do additional analysis by the transactions and related currencies, you can do by setting filters on the report. 

* In the column definition, you can use the <b> Currency filter </b> for any amount column and specify the ISO code of the currency you want to restric the column to. By setting the column to a specific currency, only transactions entered for that currency will be displayed. 

* In the row definition, you can specify a <b> Row modifier </b> with the attribute set to <b> Transaction currency </b> with a currency code listed as the restriction. By setting the row to a specific currency, likewise only transactions entered for the matching currency will be displayed. 


## Reporting on currency
By default, any amount appearing in a report will appear as the accounting currency amount. Any of the following actions will cause some level of translation to take place:
* Modifying the <b>Currency display</b> field in the column definition to <b>Reporting currency from Ledger</b>, which will bring back translated amounts as calculated in Dynamics in the Reporting currency
* Modifying the <b> Currency display </b> field in the column definition to <b> Transaction currency </b>, which will force the report to total different currencies together and display the entered amount in the column, regardless of currency
* Modifying the <b> Currency display </b> field in the column definition to any of the <b> Translate to ... </b> options, which will perform the currency translation within Financial reporting

Additionally, the following actions will also cause translation:
* Use of a reporting tree to summarize multiple legal entites with different accounting currencies. Amounts will be translated to the accounting currency based on the legal entity specified in the report definition or the current company context if the @ANY company is used in the report definition. 
* Using the <b>Currency</b> button in the web report viewer or the <b>Include all reporting currencies</b> button in Report Designer will cause additional versions of the report using translated data to be generated for each currency selected. 

For amounts being translated within Financial reporting, the following types of translation are available for use, as defined on each MainAccount. 

| Translation type  |  Description |  Example rate calculation |   
|---|---|---|
| Current | Uses the last rate on or before the period specified. Typically used for Balance Sheet accounts  |  (Rate) |   
| Weighted average  | Uses the weighted average rate for the period. Typically used for P&L accounts | ((Rate1 * Number of days in effect) + (Rate2 * Number of days in effect)) + â€¦/ Number of days in the period  |   
|  Average | This is a simpler average rate for the period. Typically used for P&L accounts  | (Sum of rates)/(number of rates)  |   
| Transaction date (Historical)  | Uses the rate in effect on the posting date of the transaction. If no rate is available will use the closest previously entered rate.  Typically used for Retained Earnings, Equity accounts and longer term fixed assets (e.g. Land)  | (Rate)  |   


### Setup for Exchange rate type
The exchange rate type defines the table of exchange rates and currencies to be used. Exchange rate type can be configured in multiple locations. 

* Within the Main accounts form within General Ledger there is an option for Exchange rate type on the Financial reporting fast tab. 
* You can also specify an override of an exchange rate type for a legal entity which will override the default behavior. 
* If no exchange rate type is specified for a main account, the exchange rate type will default from the ledger.

### Setup for Currency translation type
The Currency translation type will determine how each main account is translated. Currency translation rate type can also be configured in multiple locations. 
* Within the main accounts form within General ledger there is an option for Currency translation type on the Financial reporting fast tab. 
* You can also specify an override of a currency translation rate type for a legal entity which will overide the default behavior. 


### Setup for Retained Earnings
Retained earnings accounts are special in regards to Currency Translation as it has several requirements
* Any retained earnings account must be assigned to the Retained Earnings main account category in the Main Accounts form to translate
* If the default category was renamed, financial reporting is still expecting the original with the backing ID number of 29. 
* The retained earnings account only translates system generated transactions initiated through the fiscal year end close process. 
* The retained earnings balance is translated at the rate that exists at the end of the most recent year closed.  This means that currently it is a point in time calculation, not an accumulation of amounts and rates from the beginning balance entered. 

## Report design elements related to currency
The following are additional report design elements that can be used when doing reporting on currencies

### Auto text codes
Users can dynamically see the currency symbol, code, and description they have defined in Dynamics when the currency is changed. Three auto text options have been added to Financial reporting to enable this functionality:
* Currency symbol (@CurrencySymbol)
* Currency code (@CurrencyCode)
* Currency description (@CurrencyDescription)
You can add the auto text both in the Column Definition and in the Report Definition headers. Additionally, anywhere in a report where a currency symbol is used will update with the appropriate symbol for the currency from Dynamics. 

The places where currency symbols are used are:
* Display currency symbol on first row which is defined in the Report Definition
* Use currency format in this row (CS), defined in the Row Definition
* Format Overrides defined in the Row and Column Definition

### Financial reporting attributes related to currency
* Account Currency
* Currency code
* Transaction currency
* Acquisition date

### Currency Translation Adjustment
The currency translation adjustment (CTA) is the difference between the rates used to calculate the balance sheet accounts and the rate used for the income statement accounts. This difference in rates will cause the balance sheet to be out of balance. 

You can use Financial reporting to calculate the CTA in two ways: 

1. Use the Rounding Adjustments form in the row definition

When you enter the row in which you want to display the CTA, the total assets row, the total liabilities and equity row, and the threshold you are comfortable with, Financial reporting ill calculate this difference and put it in the desired row. A line named Rounding Adjustment will be created and shown upon drill-down, as shown in Figure 24. 
 
2. Create a single line with all accounts to calculate the CTA. 

Put all of the accounts in a range, from assets to expenses. This difference will be the same amount as the rounding adjustment (CTA) and can be used as a check total to make sure the rounding adjustment form is not including any missed account balance
