# Reporting on currency
By default, any amount appearing in a report will appear as the accounting currency amount. Any of the following actions will cause some level of translation to take place:
* Use of a reporting tree to summarize multiple legal entites with different accounting currencies
* Modifying the (?) currency field in the column definition
* Modifying the (?) currency in the row definition
* Using the (?) currency in the web viewer or the options pane of the web viewer

For amounts being translated, the following types of translation are available for use, as defined on each MainAccount. 


| Translation type  |  Description |  Example calculation |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current | Uses the last rate in the period. Typically used on Balance Sheet accounts  |  test |   |
|  Average | Uses average rate for the period. Typically used on P&L accounts  | (sum of rates)/(number of rates)  |   |
| Weighted average  | Uses weighted average rate for the period. Typically used on P&L accounts | ((Rate1 * Number of days in effect) + (Rate2 * Number of days in effect)) + â€¦/ Number of days in the month  |   |
| Transaction date (Historical)  | Uses the rate in effect on the posting date of the transaction. Typically used on Retained Earnings, Equity accounts and longer term fixed assets (i.e. Land)  |   |   |
