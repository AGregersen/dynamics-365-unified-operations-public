## Overview
Financial reporting has a wide variety of features in order to support complex currency reporting requirements. Financial reporting can report on any of the following currency amounts:
* Accounting currency amount 
* Reporting currency amount 
* Transaction currency amount 
* Translate to any currency setup within Dynamics 365 for Finance

## Filtering by currency
By default all report amounts are summarized and presented in the accounting currency of that company. If you need to do additional analysis by the transactions and related currencies, you can do by setting filters on the report. 

* In the column definition, you can use the <b> Currency filter </b> for any amount column and specify the ISO code of the currency you want to restric the column to. By setting the column to a specific currency, only transactions entered for that currency will be displayed. 

* In the row definition, you can specify a <b> Row modifier </b> with the attribute set to <b> Transaction currency </b> with a currency code listed as the restriction. By setting the row to a specific currency, likewise only transactions entered for the matching currency will be displayed. 


## Reporting on currency
By default, any amount appearing in a report will appear as the accounting currency amount. Any of the following actions will cause some level of translation to take place:
* Modifying the <b>Currency display</b> field in the column definition to <b>Reporting currency from Ledger</b>, which will bring back translated amounts as calculated in Dynamics in the Reporting currency
* Modifying the <b> Currency display </b> field in the column definition to <b> Transaction currency </b>, which will force the report to total different currencies together and display the entered amount in the column, regardless of currency
* Modifying the <b> Currency display </b> field in the column definition to any of the <b> Translate to ... </b> options, which will perform the currency translation within Financial reporting

Additionally, the following actions will also cause translation:
* Use of a reporting tree to summarize multiple legal entites with different accounting currencies. Amounts will be translated to the accounting currency based on the legal entity defined in the Reporting Tree or logged current logged in company if the @ANY company is used. 
* Using the <b>Currency</b> button in the web report viewer or the <b>Include all reporting currencies</b> button in Report Designer will cause additional versions of the report using translated data to be generated for each currency selected. 

For amounts being translated within Financial reporting, the following types of translation are available for use, as defined on each MainAccount. 

| Translation type  |  Description |  Example rate calculation |   
|---|---|---|
| Current | Uses the last rate on or before the period specified. Typically used for Balance Sheet accounts  |  (Rate) |   
| Weighted average  | Uses the weighted average rate for the period. Typically used for P&L accounts | ((Rate1 * Number of days in effect) + (Rate2 * Number of days in effect)) + â€¦/ Number of days in the period  |   
|  Average | This is a simpler average rate for the period. Typically used for P&L accounts  | (Sum of rates)/(number of rates)  |   
| Transaction date (Historical)  | Uses the rate in effect on the posting date of the transaction. If no rate is available will use the closest previously entered rate.  Typically used for Retained Earnings, Equity accounts and longer term fixed assets (e.g. Land)  | (Rate)  |   


### Setup for Exchange rate type
The exchange rate type defines the table of exchange rates and currencies to be used. Exchange rate type can be configured in multiple locations. 

* Within the Main accounts form within General Ledger there is an option for Exchange rate type on the Financial reporting fast tab. 
* You can also specify an override of an exchange rate type for a legal entity which will override the default behavior. 
* If no exchange rate type is specified for a main account, the exchange rate type will default from the ledger.

## Setup for Currency translation type
The Currency translation type will determine how each main account is translated. Exchange rate type can also be configured in multiple locations. 
* Within the main accounts form within General ledger there is an option for Currency translation type on the Financial reporting fast tab. 
* You can also specify an override of an exchange rate type for a legal entity which will overide the default behavior.
