Asset leasing offers an advanced capability for managing, tracking, and automating lessee financial transactions for leased assets in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. Asset leasing complies with international accounting standards (IFRS 16) and US GAAP standards (ASC 842). Asset leasing captures and processes main lease information, and calculates journal entries for the lifecycle of the lease from initial recognition and monthly journal entries, to impairment and termination of the lease. Asset leasing integrates seamlessly with Fixed assets, Accounts payable and General ledger.

> [!Note] 
> For more information regarding accounting standards, refer to the standard documentation of IFRS 16 and US GAAP ASC 842.
