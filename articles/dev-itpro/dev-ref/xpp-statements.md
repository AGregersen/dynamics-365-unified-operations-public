# Statements

This topic describes statements in X++.

## Comments
--------

It's a good practice to add comments to your code. Comments make a program easier to read and understand. Comments are ignored when the program is compiled. Your comments can use either the **//** style or the **/\*** style. However, a best practice is to use the **//** style for comments, and even for multiline comments.

    // This is an example of a comment.
    /* Here is another example of a comment. */
## print statements
You use the **print** statement to show messages (text or selected results) in a temporary window. This window appears when the first **print** statement is executed. During testing, the **print** statement can be a convenient alternative to the **Global::info** method, which shows text in the Infolog. The following table compares the **print** statement and the **Global::info** method.

| Feature                                   | print statement                                                                                                                             | Info method                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ease of invocation                        | The **print** statement automatically converts various data types into strings. It can convert multiple data types in one invocation.       | The **info** method requires that the input parameter be a string.               |
| Ability to copy contents to the clipboard | The contents of the window that the **print** statement opens can't be copied to the clipboard. You can't give the window focus.            | Infolog contents are easily copied from the **Infolog** window to the clipboard. |
| Scope of lifetime                         | The window closes when the X++ application ends, and it might close before you have time to read it.                                        | The window persists for the whole client session.                                |
| Size and location                         | The window can be a specific size and in a specific location on the screen.                                                                 | The window is sized and placed by the system.                                    |
| Typical usage                             | The **print** statement is used for convenience during testing. It can help you debug small issues without having to run a formal debugger. | The **info** method is appropriate for use in production.                        |

### Example of a print statement

    // This example demonstrates the print statement automatically converting any
    // date type to a string. 
    static void PrintJob2(Args _args)
    {
        str s1 = "Hello";
        int n2 = 42;
        utcDateTime udt3 = DateTimeUtil::utcNow();
        Dialog dlog4 = new Dialog();
        print "The print statement automatically converts data types to strings.";
        print s1, " -- ", n2, " -- ", udt3, " -- ", dlog4;
        Global::info("User clicked 'Yes' to continue to this call to info.");
        info(int2Str(n2)); // int2Str converter is needed.
    }
    /***  Output to the Print window:
    The print statement automatically converts data types to strings.
    Hello -- 42 -- 10/3/2011 09:18:10 pm -- 1
    ***/

    /***  Output to Infolog window:
    Message (02:18:10 pm)
    User clicked 'Yes' to continue to this call to info.
    ***/

## TODO comments
The compiler recognizes the string **TODO** when it occurs at the start of a comment. The **TODO** string prompts the compiler to report the rest of the comment text in the **Task List** window in Microsoft Visual Studio. To open the **Task List** window, select **View**, and then select **Task Window**. The **Task Window** reports the line number where the **TODO** comment can be found in the code. Here are the rules for using **TODO** in comments:

- The **TODO** string can appear in a comment that uses either the **//** style or the **/** style.
- The **TODO** string must be the very first nonâ€“white space string in the comment. A carriage return, a line feed, a tab, and a space are all considered white space.
- No white space is required between the start of the comment and the **TODO**.
- The **TODO** string is case-insensitive. However, the convention is to type **TODO** in all uppercase letters, instead of **ToDo** or another variation.
- The **TODO** string can have any characters appended to it. However, the convention is either to append a colon to the **TODO** string or to follow it with a white space.
- The rest of the comment after the **TODO** string is reported as the task description. If the comment is longer than 200 characters, it might appear truncated on the **Tasks** tab.
- The**TODO** task description can be spread over multiple lines when the **/** comment style is used.

### Examples of TODO comments

The following examples show <strong>TODO</strong> comments that use the **//** and **/** styles.

    // An example of using TODO in the // style of comment.
    public boolean isLate()
    {
        // TODO: Finish this stub. 
        return true;
    }

    // An example of using TODO in the /* */ style of comment.
    public boolean isLate()
    {
        /* TODO Finish this stub */
        return true;
    }

## Unsupported statements: changeSite, pause, and window
The **changeSite**, **pause**, and **window** keywords are no longer a part of the X++ language. These keywords will cause compilation errors if you use them.

## using clauses
You use **using** clauses so that you don't have to provide the fully qualified name of a type. The **using** clause must precede the class that it applies, and it's required in every source file that you want it to apply to. Typically, all **using** clauses are put at the beginning of the source file. You can also provide aliases that introduce a short name for a fully qualified name. Aliases can denote namespaces or classes. The following example shows a **using** clause, a namespace alias, and a class alias.

    using System;
    using IONS=System.IO; // Namespace alias
    using Alist=System.Collections.ArrayList; // Class alias
    public class MyClass2
    {
        public static void Main(Args a)
        {
            Int32 I; // Alternative to System.Int32
            Alist al; // Using a class alias
            al = new Alist();
            str s;
            al.Add(1);
            s = IONS.Path::ChangeExtension(@"c:\tmp\test.xml", ".txt");
        }
    }

## using statements
The **using** statement helps guarantee that objects that implement **IDisposable** are disposed of correctly. When you use an **IDisposable** object, you should declare and instantiate it in a **using** statement. The **using** statement calls the **Dispose** method on the object in the correct way, even if an exception occurs while you're calling methods on the object. You can achieve the same result by putting the object inside a **try** block and then explicitly calling **Dispose** in a **finally** block. The **using** statement simplifies the syntax and disposes of the object correctly. Here is the syntax for a **using** statement:

**using (** *expression* **) {** *statement* **}**

In this syntax, *statement* can be a block of statements, and *expression* declares and instantiates an object that implements **IDisposable**. The following example creates and uses a **StreamReader** object.

    static void AnotherMethod()
    {
        str textFromFile;
        using (System.IO.StreamReader sr = new System.IO.StreamReader("c:\\test.txt"))
        {
            textFromFile = sr.ReadToEnd();
        }
    }
