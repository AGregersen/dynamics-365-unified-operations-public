# Delivering ISV Solutions for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations using One Version

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

We have entered the era of Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations One Version. We now truly run a service with all the benefits that come with this. New updates are automatically broadcast with close to zero downtime, and customers enjoy the benefits of staying current with recent features and fixes without having to go through expensive upgrades. Feature management allows customers to control when new features are applied.

This means that you as partner can innovate together with Microsoft to take advantage of new features without the waiting times that come with long release cycles. When your customers all run on current versions, you have fewer versions to maintain. You can instead focus on building quality into the solutions you bring to your customers.

Servicing current versions is more seamless and safer compared to earlier versions where patching required us to pull together individual fixes and merge them into a customer environment.

Quality is a cornerstone of One Version. Extensibility enables deployment of side-by-side solutions that provide customers more more choices in configuring their solutions.

Under One Version, customer UAT and production environments are updated every month. It is critical we take every step to ensure that updates are done without causing issues. We acknowledge both technical and functional issues may come from updating environments.

+ Technical issues include breaking changes in APIs that are used by customizations in your solutions.
+ Functional issues seen from customers can be due to the untimely introduction of new features. Microsoft will put under feature management any new functionality that may impact existing processes. This lets customers control when new functionality is put into use, leaving time for them to validate, document, and train their users on the new features.
+ Functional issues might also be unintended changes that cause functional regressions.

Preventing technical or functional issues is a difficult proposition and requires a close coordination between Microsoft and you as an ISV partner. Our strategy is that you get to adapt similar practices as we do at Microsoft. Over the next several months we will roll out new practices and tools to help empower you in this. We will update this guidance the tools and practices evolve.
