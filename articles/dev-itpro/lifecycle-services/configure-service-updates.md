# Configure service updates through Lifecycle Services (LCS)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can configure how and when you get service updates from Microsoft to your Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations environments directly through Lifecycle Services (LCS). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available only for customers that are on **version 8.1 and above** and are **not** part of the [First release](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/public-preview-releases.md) program. We are working on enabling this for First release customers and for customers that are on older versions of the product. 

The ability to configure updates is only available for **implementation projects** and to users (customer/partner) that is assigned to the **project owner** role in LCS. To modify your update settings, use the following steps:

> [!NOTE]
> These settings only apply to service updates and have no impact on the operation system level security updates applied monthly to your environments.

1. Navigate to the **Project Settings** page in your **implementation** project.

2. A new tab called **Update settings** will be available that has the configuration options.

    - **Update environment**: Select an alternate sandbox environment to be updated prior to the production update. By default, the Tier 2 Standard Acceptance Test (Sandbox) environment included in the base offer is updated by Microsoft before applying the update on the Production environment. If you have purchased Tier 2 and above Sandbox add-on environments and would like a different Sandbox to be updated, then you can use this setting to change the default and select an alternate environment.


     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > The environment selected here will be updated 7 calendar days prior to the update cadence selected for the production environment.

    - **Production environment update cadence**: Select a recurring cadence for your Production environment updates. The Sandbox environment configured above will be updated 7 calendar days prior to the selected cadence. You can select the following:
       - Select the cadence: You can choose whether to get updates in the first, second, third week of the month.
        - Select one of the three time-zones: Select whether you want the Production updated in Eastern Time(UTC â€“ 5) or Hong Kong Time(UTC + 8) or the Greenwich Mean Time(UTC + 0).
      - Select a day of the week: Select a day in the week when you want to get the update.
      - Select a time slot: Select a time slot when you want to get the update.


     > [!NOTE]
     > At this time, we only have a few options available under the day of the week and time slot drop downs. We will soon we adding additional options include weekdays for customers.

    - **View update calendar:** Once you have set the update cadence and configured the update environment, to know exactly when environment will be updated we generate an update calendar for the next six months that shows exactly when the configured sandbox and production environments will be updated. This provides you with a level of predictability on when to expect the update. Under the Production update cadence, you will see the View update calendar link.

3. Select the configuration options and click **Save**.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Once the settings are saved you will have the ability to change them at any time. However, if there is an ongoing rollout then the saved settings will not be used to update the existing rollout timings but will be used from the next rollout onwards. Ongoing rollout is defined by the time between the email notification being sent for the sandbox update (Production update - 14 calendar days) and the Production environment being updated. 

For more details about how to pause getting updates to configured sandbox and production environments, see [Pause service updates](pause-service-updates.md) topic.

For more details about One Version and Microsoft-managed service updates, see [One Version service updates FAQ](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/one-version.md).
