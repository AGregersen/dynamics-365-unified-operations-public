# Database movement operations home page

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Database movement operations are a suite of self-service actions that can be used as part of Data Application Lifecycle Management (also referred to as *DataALM*).  These actions provide structured processes for common implementation scenarios such as golden configuration promotion, debugging/diagnostics, destructive testing, and general refresh for training purposes.

In this topic, you will learn how to use database movement operations to perform refresh, export, import, and various flavors of point-in-time restore.

## Database movement Quick Start guides
Learn how to perform the individual operations on your Standard or Premier Acceptance Test environments:
 * [Refresh database](database-refresh.md)
 * [Export database](export-database.md)
 * [Import database](import-database.md)
 * [Database point-in-time restore](database-point-in-time-restore.md)

 ## Step-by-step tutorials
 Learn how to achieve common implementation scenarios using DataALM to your advantage:
 * [General refresh for training purposes](dbmovement-scenario-general-refresh.md)
 * [Debugging and diagnostics](dbmovement-scenario-debugdiag.md)
 * ['Golden Configuration' promotion](dbmovement-scenario-goldenconfig.md)
 * [Destructive testing](dbmovement-scenario-destructivetests.md)
