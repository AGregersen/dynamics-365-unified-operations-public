# Installing BaseX for AppChecker

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

AppChecker depends on a running instance of BaseX for storage and querying of abstract syntax trees generated by the X++ compiler. This article describes how to install and set up BaseX in a developer environment.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

* BaseX is a Java-based XML document database. Therefore, a Java Runtime Environment of version 8 or higher is required to run it.

  Before installing BaseX, make sure a Java JRE is installed: [aka.ms/getjava](https://aka.ms/getjava).

## Step 2: Download BaseX

* Go to [BaseX](http://basex.org/download/) and download the latest Windows Installer. At the time of writing the latest version is 9.1.2.

## Step 3: Install BaseX

* Run the executable on the developer machine you'll be compiling your module on.
* Accept the default settings for each step.

> [!TIP]
> The BaseX server data folder can be changed later, if the installation drive does not have enough space.
