# Installing BaseX for AppChecker

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

AppChecker depends on a running instance of BaseX for storage and querying of abstract syntax trees generated by the X++ compiler. This article describes how to install and set up BaseX in a developer environment.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

* BaseX is a Java-based XML document database. Therefore, a Java Runtime Environment of version 8 or higher is required to run it.

  Before installing BaseX, make sure a Java JRE is installed: [aka.ms/getjava](https://aka.ms/getjava).

## Step 2: Download BaseX

* Go to [BaseX](http://basex.org/download/) and download the latest Windows Installer. At the time of writing the latest version is 9.1.2.

## Step 3: Install BaseX

* Run the executable on the developer machine you'll be compiling your module on.
* Accept the default settings for each step.

> [!TIP]
> The BaseX server data folder can be changed later, if the installation drive does not have enough space. See the [BaseX configuration page](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Configuration#Database_Directory) for more information.

## Step 4 [Optional]: Configuring BaseX to handle your model

Depending on the size of your model, the BaseX server can take up a lot of memory to store the abstract syntax trees.

BaseX is configured by default to use ~1.17GB of RAM at the most. If you have a large model, you should consider to increase this limit by following the steps below:

* Edit the batch script at: `<BaseX Install Path>\bin\basexhttp.bat`.
* Change the line containing `set BASEX_JVM=-Xmx1200m %BASEX_JVM%` and increase the value after `-Xmx`. [See more about increasing the limits of the Java VM here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html#BABHDABI).

  Leave everything else untouched.

> [!NOTE]
> If you make changes here after starting the BaseX server, you will need to restart the BaseX server after saving the `basexhttp.bat` file.

## Step 5: Start the BaseX server

* From the Start Menu, run the newly added `BaseX -> BaseX Server (Start)` program.

  * If you chose not to create start menu shortcuts, start the server with the following command in the Run prompt:

    ```text
    <BaseX Install Path>\BaseX\bin\basexhttp.bat -S
    ```

* This will start a BaseX server listening on ports `1984/tcp` (API), `8984/tcp` (HTTP API), and `8985/tcp` (Jetty HTTP stop port).

## Step 6 [Optional]: Start the BaseX server on login

You can choose to start BaseX when it's needed as part of your development process, or you can set it up such that it starts with Windows. This final step explains how to set up BaseX as a service.

* Open the Task Scheduler tool; you can use the following shortcut from a Run prompt: `control schedtasks`
* Right click in the Tasks list window and create a new task with the Basic task wizard.

  ![Image of the Task context menu, highlighting the "Create Basic Task..." button](./media/tasksched-create-basic-task.png)
* Name the task something like "`BaseX Start on Login`".
* Set the trigger to `When I log on`.
* Set the action to `Start a program`.
* In the `Start a program` sub-section,
  * set `Program/script` to: `<BaseX Install Path>\BaseX\bin\basexhttp.bat`, and
  * set `Add arguments` to: `-S`.

    ![Image of the Basic Task Wizard with arguments set to start "basexhttp.bat -S"](./media/tasksched-start-basex-http-server.png)
* Finalize the task creation wizard and you're set.

> [!NOTE]
> The BaseX Wiki explains how to use YAJSW to run BaseX as a service, but we recommend scheduling a task on login for the sake of simplicity.
