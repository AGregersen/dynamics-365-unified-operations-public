# Near-real time data integration between Finance and Operations and Common Data Service

In this digital world,  business eco-systems use Dynamics 365 suite as a whole. Data from people, customers, operations and IoT devices flows in to one source creating the opportunity for digital feedback loops. To achieve this experience, native integration between Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement applications is essential. Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement Applications is built on top of Common Data Services platform. Finance and Operations data integrating with Common Data Services enables the Customer Engagement applications to talk to Finance and Operations coherently and fluently.

The Finance and Operations and Common Data Service provides near real-time data synchronization between Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement applications via dual-write framework. The coverage is pretty broad and spans across 28 surface areas of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. The idea is to give users "One Dynamics 365" user experience through seamless data flows that connect the business processes across applications say from customers, products through financials.

The following value propositions are available for the customers.

-   Organization hierarchy in Common Data Service
-   Company concept in Common Data Service
-   Integrated customer master
-   Integrated vendor master
-   Unified product master

## System requirements for Finance and Operations:

Synchronous, bi-directional near-real time data flows requires the following versions.

-   Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise
    edition 10.0.4 Platform Update 28 or higher
-   Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement, Platform version 9.1 (4.2) or
