#### Financial reporting

-   **Default reports are not imported by default:** To import the default reports, do the following:

    1.  Launch Report designer by going to **General Ledger \> Inquiries and reports \> Financial reports.**
    2.  Click **New**.
    3.  Go to **Tools \> Import Default Reports**. 
    4.  Reports will load into the web client after a few minutes.

-   **Print to PDF is printing to XPS instead** (due to a print driver access issue).
