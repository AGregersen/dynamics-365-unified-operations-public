# Insider program

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Overview
========

Thank you for signing up for the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations Insider
program! We are excited to launch Finance and Operations service on our next
generation infrastructure. This multi-tenant architecture will benefit both
customers and Microsoft, as it will provide easier deployment options.

Value proposition
=================

As a customer onboarding to the new infrastructure, some of the key benefits you
will experience are:

-   **Significantly reduced deployment times:** Deployment times reduced by more
    than 30% - 50%.

-   **Self-service deployment:** Self-service deployment is now available, which
    means that you no longer need to log a service request to acquire an
    environment.

-   **Repeatable deployments:** You will now have a high degree of repeatability
    and reliability in pushing your customization updates from Sandbox to
    Production.

Who is eligible for the preview?
================================

Finance and Operations customers who have signed up for the Dynamics 365 for
Finance and Operations Deployment Insider program are eligible for the preview.

Release build version
=====================

| Application | 8.1.1     |
|-------------|-----------|
| Platform    | Update 21 |

Customizations
==============

Customizations built on Application version 8.1 and Platform update 20 are
compatible with the current release.

Whatâ€™s new or changed?
======================

-   LCS project: As part of the Insider program, you will be assigned a new
    Lifecycle Services (LCS) project that will be different from the current
    implementation project type. You will use this project to perform all
    actions related to the preview. Environment types and actions included in
    the preview are for Sandbox environments only. There is no change in
    experience to the Dev/Test environments.

-   No subscription estimator: You will no longer need to fill out the
    subscription estimator and go through the sizing process. Microsoft will be
    able to scale your workload as needed based on the following:

    -   The number of licenses purchased

    -   Your workload

-   Self-service deployment: You will now be able to trigger the environment
    deployment directly from LCS, which means that you no longer need a service
    request for deployment.

-   Move customizations from DevTest to Sandbox: Self-service will be enabled so
    you can easily apply updates and database movement scenarios across all
    environments.

-   No remote desktop access: You will no longer be able to remote desktop into
    Sandbox environments. Self-service will be enabled for all tasks that are
    commonly performed on these environments.
