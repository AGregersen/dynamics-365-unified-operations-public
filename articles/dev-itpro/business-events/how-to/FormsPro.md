# Use Microsoft Forms Pro with business events

[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic will walk you thorugh the scenario where Forms Pro can be used to create a survey, which can be used with business events.Â  

This topic provides the steps to enable a scenario where a survey is sent to users when a product has been shipped. The survey is gathered using Microsoft Forms Pro.

If you have not tried Forms Pro yet, the [Microsoft Forms Pro documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/forms-pro/) is a prerequisite to first learn how to use Foms Pro.

I created a new survey, and just from the title of the survey, it pretty much built the entire set of satisfaction questions for me through the suggestions.

On the sales order in Finance & Operations, we are tracking the shipment, and when the product is shipped, the status is changed to **Delivered**.

So I configured an alert on the sales order such that, whenever the status field is changed, it creates an alert. I also, made sure to enable the alert to **Send External**. This will make sure, the alert is sent out as a business event.

The Flow is shown below which gets triggered by the business event every time the status on a sales order is updated. The Flow then goes on to use the Forms connector to get the survey to the customer email address that is registered on the order. The customer email address and other needed information must be in the payload of the business event. If the payload does not have the required data as needed by a given scenario, the payload can be extended to include such fields. This is covered in the developer documentation of business events.

Note, since I am using Flow to orchestrate this scenario, I will let Flow subscribe to the **When a change based alert occurs** business event directly as opposed to activating the business event in Finance & Operations.

Once the Flow is completed, it is ready to go in action. Once the sales order's status is updated, the Flow gets triggered and it will send the survey. As users fill in the survey and submit, Forms Pro also shows some analytics.
