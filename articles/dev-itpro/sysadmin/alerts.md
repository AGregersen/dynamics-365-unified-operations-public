Alerts form a notification system for critical events in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. You can use alerts to stay informed about events that you want to track during the workday. You can enable a set of alert rules so that you're alerted when a batch job ended, ended in error or canceled. You can choose whether the alerts are emailed to you or appear as a pop up notification in action center.
