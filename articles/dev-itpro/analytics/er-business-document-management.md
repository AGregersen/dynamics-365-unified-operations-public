# Business document management overview

[Electronic reporting (ER) framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting) can be used by business users to configure formats for outbound documents in accordance with the legal requirements of various countries/regions. Such users can also define the dataflow specifying what application data will be placed to generated documents. ER framework is capable to generate outbound documents in Microsoft office formats (Excel workbook, Word document) by using predefined templates. Such templates are filled in by required data in accordance to configured dataflow while required documents are generated. Each configured format can be published as part of an ER solution to generate specific outbound documents. This part of an ER solution is represented by an ER format configuration that may contain templates for generation of different outbound documents. This ER capability allows business users to use this framework for managing required business documents.

**Business document management** (BDM) is built on top of the ER framework. It enables business users to edit templates of business documents from the provided ER solutions by using either Microsoft Office 365 service or appropriate Microsoft Office desktop application including changing business documents designs and adding placeholders for additional data from within Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations without source code changes and new deployments. No knowledge of the ER framework is required from such business users to update templates of business documents.

## Configure ER parameters

As BDM is built on top of the ER framework, you must configure necessary ER parameters to start working with BDM. Set up the ER parameters as described in the [Configure the ER framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters) page. Add a new configuration provider as described in the  [Create configuration providers and mark them as active](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/tasks/er-configuration-provider-mark-it-active-2016-11) page.

## Configure BDM parameters

This topic explains how to set up the basic parameters for BDM. It also describes the steps that you must complete before you can set up BDM.

### Prerequisites for BDM parameters setup
Before you can set up BDM, you must set up the required document type in the Document management (DM) framework. This document type is used in BDM to specify a temporary storage of documents in Office formats (Excel, Word) that are used as templates for ER reports. Storing in this temporary storage templates can be edited by using the Office desktop applications.

For this document type, the following attribute values must be selected:

| **Attribute name**  | **Attribute value**   |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Class               | Attach file           |
| Group               | File                  |
| Location            | SharePoint            |

Review the [Configure document management](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/organization-administration/configure-document-management) page to set up the required DM parameters and document type.

![Setting of Document management document type](./media/BDM-Overview-DMSetting.png)

### Set up BDM parameters

Basic parameters of BDM can be set up in the **Business document parameters** page. Note that the only following users can access it:

- Users playing the **System administrator** role.
- Users playing any other role that is configured to perform the **Maintain Business document management parameters** (AOT name **ERBDMaintainParameters**) duty.

Use the following procedure to set up the basic parameters of BDM for all legal entities.

1.	Login to the current instance of the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations as a user having access to the **Business document parameters** page.
2.	Open the **Organization administration \> Electronic reporting \> Business document management \> Business document parameters** page.
3.	On the **Business document parameters** page, on the **Attachments** tab, for the **SharePoint document type** parameter define the document type that should be used to temporary store templates in Microsoft Office formats while they are edited by using the Office desktop applications. Note that the only configured as using SharePoint location document types are available for this parameter.

![Setting of BDM parameters](./media/BDM-Overview-BDMSetting.png)

Pay attention to the fact that the selected document type is company specific. It will be used when user is working with the BDM in the company for which the selected document type is configured. When user is working with the BDM in any other company, selected in this parameter document type will be used as well if the document type with same name has not been configured for this company. When such document type has been configured for this company, it will be used instead of the one selected in the **SharePoint document type** parameter.

## Configure BDM access permissions

By default when the usage of access permissions for BDM is disabled, every user that has access to the BDM workspace will see in this workspace all templates of the ER solutions that are available in the current instance of the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. Note that the BDM workspace will show only templates that reside in ER format configurations that are marked by any **Business document type** tag.

![ER configurations page](./media/BDM-Overview-ERFormatTags.png)

The list of offered for a single user in the BDM workspace templates can be restricted by configuring BDM access permissions. It is rather important when different templates are used to produce business documents for different business domains (functional areas), and you want to allow accessing different templates for editing in the BDM workspace for users playing different roles.

BDM access permissions can be set up in the **Configurator of access permissions** page. Note that the only following users can access it:

- Users playing the **System administrator** role.
- Users playing any other role that is configured to perform the **Configure permissions to access Business document templates for editing** (AOT name **ERBDTemplatesSecurity**) duty.

Use the following procedure to set up access permissions of BDM for all legal entities.

- Login to the current instance of the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations as a user having access to the **Configurator of access permissions** page.
- Open the **Organization administration \> Electronic reporting \> Business document management \> Manage access permissions** to edit templates page.

Pay attention to the notification informing you that currently the usage of access permissions for BDM is disabled.

![Configurator of BDM access permissions page](./media/BDM-Overview-TemplatesAccess1.png)

It means that, with this setting, every user playing any security role that is configured to perform the **Manage Business document templates** (AOT name **ERBDManageTemplates**) duty is able to open the BDM workspace accessing for editing every template that is available in the current instance of the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

The presented below picture shows what the BDM workspace will offer for **ALICE** persona playing the **Accounts receivable clerk** role â€“ with the current BDM access permissions setting she is able to edit templates of business document from different functional areas (**Invoicing**, **Foreign trade** and **Payments**).

![BDM workspace page](./media/BDM-Overview-TemplatesForAlice1.png)

- On the **Configurator of access permissions** page, select the **Access permissions setting**.
- On the **Settings of access permissions to edit templates** dialog, turn on the **Apply configured access permissions** option.
- Select **OK** to confirm that the usage of BDM access permissions has been turned on.

Note that now you are informed about the necessity of setting access permissions. Lack of access permissions now means that none of templates will be shown in the BDM workspace for any user.

![Configurator of BDM access permissions page](./media/BDM-Overview-TemplatesAccess2.png)

- Select **Add** to enter a new business role for which permissions to access BDM templates must be configured.
- On the **Security roles** pop-up dialog, select the **Accounts receivable clerk** role.
- Select **OK** to confirm the role selection.
- On the **Access permissions per tags of configurations** tab, select the **New** option.
- Select the **Functional area** value in the **Tag type** field.
- Select the **Invoicing** value in the **Id** field.
- Select **Save** to store configured access permissions for the selected role.

The current setting means that for any user playing the **Accounts receivable clerk** role and performing the **Manage Business document templates** (AOT name **ERBDManageTemplates**) duty the BDM workspace will offer for editing templates from only ER format configurations having the **Invoicing** value for the **Functional area** tag.

- Toggle the **Related information** pane from the right-hand side of the current page.

Note that the **Related information** pane shows how the configured access permissions will be applied â€“ templates from what ER format configurations will be available for what users playing the currently selected **Accounts receivable clerk** role.

![Configurator of BDM access permissions page](./media/BDM-Overview-TemplatesAccess3.png)

- On the **Access permissions per configurations** tab, select the **Add** option.
- On the **Select configuration** pop-up dialog, mark the **Intrastat report** ER format configuration.
- Select **OK** to confirm the entry of the selected configurations.
- Select **Save** to store configured access permissions for the selected role.

The current setting means that for any user playing the **Accounts receivable clerk** role and performing the **Manage Business document templates** (AOT name **ERBDManageTemplates**) duty the BDM workspace will offer for editing the following templates:

- Templates from ER format configurations having the **Invoicing** value for the **Functional area** tag.
- Templates from ER format configurations mentioned in the **Access permissions per configurations** tab (templates from the **Intrastat report** format configuration of the **Statutory reporting** domain in our case).

![Configurator of BDM access permissions page](./media/BDM-Overview-TemplatesAccess4.png)

The presented below picture shows what the BDM workspace will offer for **ALICE** persona playing the **Accounts receivable clerk** role â€“ with the current BDM access permissions setting she is able to edit templates of business document from the only **Invoicing** domain and the **Intrastat report** ER format configuration. Templates of business document from the **Payments** domain are not accessible for **ALICE** persona any longer.

![BDM workspace page](./media/BDM-Overview-TemplatesForAlice2.png)

Be aware that the **Access permissions per configurations** rules are stored by using the unique identification ID of an ER format configuration. It means that these rules will not be deleted while referred ER configurations are deleted. When you imported deleted configurations back to this instance of the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, these rules will refer to them again. There is no need to set these rules up again after the re-importing of earlier deleted ER format configurations.

## Use BDM to edit templates

Business users can access for editing templates of business documents in the BDM workspace. Note that the only following users can access this workspace:

- Users playing the **System administrator** role.
- Users playing any other role that is configured to perform the **Manage Business document templates** (AOT name **ERBDManageTemplates**) duty.

## Frequently asked questions

**Q**: I selected the **New document** option. But instead of the **BDM template editor** page of the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, I have been navigated to the Office 365 web page.

**A**: It is the known issue with the Office 365 redirection back to the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. It happens when you log on to the office 365 the first time. To work around this issue, click the **Back** button of your browser to navigate back to the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

**Q**: It has been described how I can edit a template by using the Office 365 in 1st  application session and execute the containing this template ER format in 2nd application session every time I adjusted this template to see how my changes affects the finally generated business document. can I do the same using the Office desktop application for editing same template?

**A**: Yes, you can do this. Select the **Open in Desktop App** option in 1st application session: your template will be stored in the temporary file storage and opened in the Office desktop application. Now you can perform the following steps to preview your templateâ€™s changes in the generated business document:

-	Make changes in the template by using the Office desktop application.
-	Select **Save** in using the Office desktop application.
-	Select **Sync stored copy** in the **BDM template editor** page of 1st application session.
-	Execute the containing this template ER format in 2nd application session.

**Q**: I selected the **Open in Desktop App** option but gets the â€˜Value cannot be null. Parameter name: externalIdâ€™ error message. How this issue can be resolved to allow me using the Office desktop application for editing my templates?

**A**: Most likely, you logged into the current instance of the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations as a user configured as user of the Azure AD domain which differs from the Azure AD domain used to deploy this Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations instance. As the SharePoint service (that is used to store templates for making them available for editing by using the office desktop applications) belongs to the same domain as the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, we have no permissions to access the SharePoint service. To resolve this issue, login to the current instance of the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations using credentials of a user of the proper Azure AD domain.
