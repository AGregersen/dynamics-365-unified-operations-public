# Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) to design Electronic reporting (ER) configurations. The ER tool provides access to the list of configurations that have been configured in each instance of RCS that has been provisioned for your company. By using this feature, you can import configurations that you configured in an RCS instance into the current Finance and Operations instance. Once imported, the configurations can be used for handling incoming documents or for generation of outgoing electronic documents.

To learn more about this feature, play the task guide, ER Import configurations from RCS (part of the 7.5.4.3 Acquire/Develop IT service/solution components (10677) business process), which walks through how the ER configurations can be imported from RCS instance into the current Finance and Operations instance.
