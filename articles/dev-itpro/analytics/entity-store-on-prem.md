# PowerBI.com integration with on-premises environments

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Cloud version on Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations (F&O) provides several features that enable deeper integration with PowerBI. Some of these capabilities are not yet implemented on Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations on-premises deployments. With the availability of Entity store in on-premises deployments, customers can leverage PowerBI.com for reporting and analytics with F&O data. 
This document outlines the Analytics capabilities available in on-premises deployments with Platform update 26 and later.

## Enable Entity Store on-premises 
This topic supplements the topic, [Set up and deploy on-premises environments](../deployment/setup-deploy-on-premises-pu12.md). The section numbers in this topic, correspond to the sections in that topic.

## [3. Plan your users and service accounts](../deployment/setup-deploy-on-premises-pu12.md#plansvcacct)

| User account               | Type     | Purpose                                                                                                                                              | User name       |
|----------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| AOS SQL AXDW DB Admin user | SQL user | Finance and Operations uses this user to populate the AXDW database. The user is optional and must be created only if you want Entity Store support. | axdwadmin       |
| AOS SQL AXDW FB Admin user | SQL user | Finance and Operations uses this user to populate the AXDW database. The user is optional and must be created only if you want Entity Store support. | axdwruntimeuser |

## [14. Configure the databases](../deployment/setup-deploy-on-premises-pu12.md#configuredb)
The steps in this section are optional.
If you want to create database to use for Entity Store, the first thing you need to do is make changes in ConfigTemplate.xml. 

1. Under **DbServer â€“ Security**, set the **generateUser** flags for **axdwadmin** and **axdwruntimeuser** to **True**. When you do this, scripts run in the next step will create those two users. You will be prompted to set passwords for those users.
2. Execute the following scripts.

        .\Initialize-Database.ps1 -ConfigurationFilePath .\ConfigTemplate.xml -ComponentName EntityStore
        .\Configure-Database.ps1 -ConfigurationFilePath .\ConfigTemplate.xml -ComponentName EntityStore

    The *Initialize-Database.ps1* script will do the following:
    
      - Create an empty database named AXDW. This database is used for Entity Store.
      - Create a new user that has SQL authentication enabled (axdwadmin) and ask for the user's password.
      - Create a new user that has SQL authentication enabled (axdwruntimeuser) and ask for the user's password.
      - Grant **axdwadmin** and **axdwruntimeuser** db_owner permissions on the database.
    
    The *Configure-Database.ps1* script will do the following:
      - Set the specified database file and log settings.
      - GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO axdwadmin.
      - GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO axdwruntimeuser.

## [15. Encrypt credentials](../deployment/setup-deploy-on-premises-pu12.md#encryptcred)
Create the Credentials.json file, as shown here. The **AosDWAuth** category is optional and being used only if Entity Store is enabled.

    {
        "AosPrincipal": {
            "AccountPassword": "<encryptedDomainUserPassword>"
        },
        "AosSqlAuth": {
            "SqlUser": "<encryptedSqlUser>",
            "SqlPwd": "<encryptedSqlPassword>"
        },
        "AosDWAuth": {
            "DWUser": "<encryptedDWUser>",
            "DWPwd": "<encryptedDWPassword>",
            "DWRuntimeUser": "<encryptedDWRuntimeUser>",
            "DWRuntimePwd": "<encryptedDWRuntimePassword>"
        }
    }

- **AccountPassowrd** is the encrypted domain user password for the AOS domain user (contoso\axserviceuser).
- **SqlUser** is the encrypted SQL user (axdbadmin) that has access to the Finance and Operations database (AXDB), and **SqlPwd** is the encrypted SQL password.
- **DWUser** is the encrypted SQL user (axdwadmin) that has access to the Entity Store database (AXDW), and **DWPwd** is the encrypted SQL password that is entered during running of *Initialize-Database.ps1* script.
- **DWRuntimeUser** is the encrypted SQL user (axdwruntimeuser) that has access to the Entity Store database (AXDW), and **DWRuntimePwd** is the encrypted SQL password that is entered during running of *Initialize-Database.ps1* script.

## Additional Information
Entity Store was enabled in the release of Platform update 26.

Creating Entity Store database and users is optional. When configuring deployment in Lifecycle Services (LCS), user can leave Entity Store customizations empty.

If Entity Store should be enabled on environment, the following must be completed:

- AXDW database created using the scripts provided in step 14.
- **axdwadmin** and **axdwruntimeuser** users created with appropriate privileges using the scripts in step 14. Users are defined in following files: ConfigTemplate.xml and DatabaseTopologyDefinition.xml   .
- Credentials.json created as described in step 15. Usernames and passwords for **axdwadmin** and **axdwruntimeuser** should be defined as in step 14 and encrypted.
- Entity Store SQL Server name and Entity Store Database name values filled in during deployment in LCS. 

    - The database name is created in step 14 and is defined in DatabaseTopologyDefinition.xml. The default name is **AXDW**.
    - The SQL Server name is the fully qualified domain name of the Microsoft SQL Server or Always on listener. For example, **sqlinstance.onprem.contoso.com**. It is the server on which **AXDW** is created.

Enabling Entity Store is currently possible only during initial deployment. If it needs to  be enabled on an existing environment, then that environment needs to be deleted and deployed again using a platform update that supports entity store.

## Authoring and distributing reports with Entity store on-premises
Entity store is an Operational data warehouse that is included with Finance and Operations. Entity store enables Power users and Business Analysts to author reports using simplified and enriched Finance and Operations data. Entity store contains Aggregate measurements, which are simplified star schemas. For more information about authoring reports with entity store, see [Create analytical reports by using Power BI Desktop](author-distribute-power-bi-reports.md).

Note the following additional steps that are specific to on-premises deployments:

- Using LCS to deploy PowerBI reports to production or sandbox environments is not required in on-premises environments. Because administrators can point PowerBI.com datasets to specific Entity store databases in on-premise environments, there is no need to use the functionality offered by LCS. You may need to configure the on-premises gateway to enable PowerBI.com to access data on premises. For more information on gateway, see [PowerBI gateway documentation](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/gateway/).
- While cloud-based Finance and Operations environments support only reports authored with DirectQuery option, on-premises Entity store supports both DirectQuery as well as Import mode reports.
- Analytical workspaces are not yet implemented in on-premises deployments. Instead of viewing reports in Analytical workspaces, these reports can be deployed to PowerBI.com environments and used with users who have access to PowerBI.com. Your users may need appropriate licenses to access reports in PowerBI.com.
