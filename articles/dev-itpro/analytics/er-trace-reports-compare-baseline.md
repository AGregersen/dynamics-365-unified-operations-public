# Trace generated report results and compare them with baseline values

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can trace the results of Electronic reporting (ER) formats that generate outgoing electronic documents. When trace generation is turned on (ER user parameter **Run in debug mode**), a new trace record is generated in the ER format execution log every time that an ER report is run. The following details are stored in each trace that is generated:

- All warnings that were generated by validation rules
- All errors that were generated by validation rules
- All generated files that are stored as attachments of the trace record

You can store individual baseline application files for any ER format. Files are considered baseline files when they describe the expected results of reports that are run. If a baseline file is available for an ER format that was run while trace generation was turned on, the trace stores, in addition to the details that were mentioned earlier, the result of the comparison of the generated electronic document to the baseline file. In one click, you can also get the generated electronic document and its baseline file in a single zip file. You can then do detailed comparison by using an external tool such as Windiff.

You can evaluate the trace to analyze whether the electronic documents that are generated include the expected content. You can do this evaluation in a user acceptance testing (UAT) environment when the code base has been changed (for example, when you migrated to a new instance of the application, installed hotfix packages, or deployed code modifications). In this way, you can make sure that the evaluation doesn't affect the execution of ER reports that are used. For many ER reports, the evaluation can be done in unattended mode.

To learn more about this feature, play the **ER Generate reports and compare results (Part 1)** and **ER Generate reports and compare results (Part 2)** task guides, which are part of the **7.5.4.3 Test IT services/solutions (10679)** business process, and can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=874684). These task guides walk you through the process of configuring the ER framework to use baseline files to evaluate generated electronic documents.

## Example: Trace generated report results and compare them with baseline values

This procedure explains how to configure the ER framework to collect information about ER format executions and evaluate the results of those executions. As part of that evaluation, generated documents are compared with their baseline files. In this example, you will create the required ER configurations for the sample company, Litware, Inc. This procedure is intended for users who have the System administrator or Electronic reporting developer role assigned to them. These steps can be completed by using any data set.

To complete the steps in this example, you must first complete the steps in [Create a configuration provider and mark it as active](tasks/er-configuration-provider-mark-it-active-2016-11.md).

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Workspaces \> Electronic reporting**.
2. On the **Localization configurations** page, in the **Configuration providers** section, make sure that the configuration provider for the Litware, Inc. sample company is listed, and that it's marked as **Active**. If you don't see this configuration provider, follow the steps in [Create a configuration provider and mark it as active](tasks/er-configuration-provider-mark-it-active-2016-11.md).

### Configure document management parameters
1.	In Finance and Operations, on the **Organization administration >  Document management > Document types page**, create a new document type that will be used to store baseline files. Enter **Attach file** in the **Class** field and **File** in the **Group** field.

Note that the new document type with same name must be configured for each data set in which the ER baseline feature is planned to be used.

### Configure ER parameters to start using the baseline feature
1.	On the **Electronic reporting** workspace, select **Electronic reporting parameters**.

### Design a format
For this example, you will create a simple ER format to generate XML documents. 
    
1. Select **Designer**.
2. Select **Add root** to open the drop dialog.

    1. In the tree, select **Common\File**.
    2. In the **Name** field, type **Output**.
    3. Select **OK**.
    
3. Select Add to open the drop dialog.

    1. In the tree, select **XML\Element**.
    2. In the **Name** field, type **Document**.
    3. Select **OK**.
    
4. In the tree, select **Output\Document**.
5. Select **Add** to open the drop dialog.

    1. In the tree, select **XML\Attribute**.
    2. In the **Name** field, type **Id**.
    3. Select **OK**.

Based on the designed structure, configured format will generate an XML file containing the **Root** element with the **Id** attribute having the value that is entered by the end user at ER runtime dialog.

### Generate a new baseline file for designed ER format
1.	Select **Run** in the **Versions** Fast tab.
2.	In the **Enter Id** field, type **1**.
3.	Select **OK**.

4.	Save a local copy of the **OUT.ADMIN.XML** file that is generated, so that you can use it later as a baseline for this ER format.

![Screenshot of the Electronic reporting configurations page](media/GER-BaselineSample-FormatRunToMakeBaselineFile2.PNG)

### Configure ER parameters to use the baseline feature
1.	On the **Action Pane**, select **Configurations**.
2.	Select **User parameters**.
3.	Select **Yes** in the **Run in debug mode** field.
4.	Select **OK**.

### Add a new baseline for designed ER format
1.	Go to **Organization administration > Electronic reporting > Configurations**.
2.	Select **Baselines**.

![Screenshot of the Electronic reporting configurations page](media/GER-BaselineSample-OpenBaselinePage.PNG)

3.	On the **Action Pane**, select **New**.
4.	Select the **Format to learn ER baselines** ER format that you previously designed.
5.	Select **Save**.

![Screenshot of the Electronic reporting baselines page](media/GER-BaselineSample-AddBaseline.PNG)

The baseline has been added for the selected **Format to learn ER baselines** format.

### Configure a baseline rule for added baseline
1.	Select **Attachments**.
2.	Select **New**.
3.	Select the **File** document type as it has been selected in ER parameters as a document type using to store baseline files.
4.	Click **Browse** and navigate to the **OUT.ADMIN.XML** file that was generated when you executed the configured ER format earlier.

![Screenshot of the Document management attachment page](media/GER-BaselineSample-UploadBaselineFile.PNG)

5.	Close the **Attachments** page.
6.	Select **New** in the **Baselines** Fast tab.
7.	In the **Name** field, type **Baseline 1**.
8.	In the **File component name** field, enter or select the **Output** value. This selection means that the configured baseline will be compared with a file that is generated by using the **Output** format element.
9.	In the **File name mask** field, type ***.xml**. Note that you can define the file name mask. When the file name mask is defined, the baseline record will be used to evaluate the generated output only when the name of the output file that is generated satisfies that mask.
10.	In the **Companies** field, select the desired companies if you want to use the configured baseline only when the **Format to learn ER baselines** ER format is executed by user logged to one of them.
11.	In the **Baseline** field, enter or select the **OUT.ADMIN** attachment.
12.	Select **Save**.

Note that the execution log contains information about the results of the comparison of the generated file with the configured baseline. It indicates that they are equal.

8.	Select **Delete all**.

### Run designed ER format and review the log to analyze the results
1.	Go to **Organization administration > Electronic reporting > Configurations**.
2.	In the tree, expand **Model to learn ER baselines**.
3.	In the tree, select **Model to learn ER baselines\Format to learn ER baselines**.
4.	Select **Run** in the **Versions** Fast tab.
5.	In the **Enter Id** field, type **2**.
6.	Select **OK**.
