# Create an onboarding template

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 for Talent: Onboard provides you with a variety of templates to get you up and running with an onboarding guide as quickly as possible. You can use one or more of these, or you can create your own templates. Onboard provides sample text you can use when creating your own templates, so it's even easy to start from scratch.

## Create an onboarding template from an existing template

1. On the left-hand menu, select **Templates**.

2. Select a template under **Popular templates from the gallery** or under **My templates**. To view more templates, select **More in template gallery**.

3. If this is a template from the gallery, select **Save as my template**, enter a new name for the template, and select **Save**. If this is a template from **My templates**, select **Save as template**, enter a new name for the template, and select **Save**.

## Add or edit activities

1. On the **Activities** tab, drag and drop items from the right to the editing area. You can do the following:

    - Organize your guide into sections. Drag and drop **New section** to the editing area and enter a name and optional description for the section.

    - Add activities for the new hire to complete. Drag and drop **New activity** to the editing area and enter a name and description for the activity. 

    - Add a YouTube video. Drag and drop **YouTube** to the editing area, enter a name and description for the activity, and then enter a YouTube video URL.

    - Add a Sway presentation or newsletter. Drag and drop **Sway** to the editing area, enter a name and description for the activity, and then enter a Sway embedded URL.

    - Add a PowerApps app. Drag and drop **PowerApps** to the editing area, enter a name and description for the activity, and then choose a PowerApps app or enter a PowerApps app ID.

    - Add a Microsoft Stream video. Drag and drop **Microsoft Stream** to the editing area, enter a name and description for the activity, and then enter a Microsoft Stream video URL. 

    - Add a Microsoft Forms form. Drag and drop **Microsoft Forms** to the editing area, enter a name and description for the activity, and then enter a Microsoft Forms URL and specify the size for the screen area.

2. If desired, in the right-hand area of each activity, assign activities to a person or role, add a due date and contact person, and assign a category color. When you assign an activity to a person or a role, this creates a task for each individual, which appears in the **Tasks** menu in Onboard.
