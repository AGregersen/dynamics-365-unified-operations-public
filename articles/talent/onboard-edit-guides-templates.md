[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

Once you create an onboarding guide or template in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent: Onboard, you need to add an introduction, activities, contacts, and resources. Onboard lets you include rich content in your onboarding guides, including:

- YouTube videos
- Sway presentations
- PowerApps apps
- Microsoft Stream videos
- Microsoft forms forms
- Iframes with web content

## Add or edit an introduction

1. On the **Introduction** tab, enter a title for your guide and enter an opening message. To use the sample text, select **Use this message**.
