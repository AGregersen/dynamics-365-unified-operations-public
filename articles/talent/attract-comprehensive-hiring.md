# Which version of Attract?

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The version of Attract that's right for you depends on your organization's size and needs. The basic version of Attract provides a subset of functionality geared towards smaller teams or organizations, where the hiring manager is the primary user. You can start using the basic version of Attract with one or more licenses.

Attract with the Comprehensive Hiring Add-On targets medium to large teams or organizations where the recruiter or talent specialist is the primary user. The Comprehensive Hiring Add-On requires the purchase licenses through a [Dynamics 365 partner](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/partners/find-a-partner/).

>[!NOTE]
>The Attract trial showcases Attract with the Comprehensive Hiring Add-On, which contains comprehensive recruiting and hiring capabilities. These include the ability to post jobs to an Attract career site or external recruiting site such as LinkedIn. If you choose the basic version of Attract, your subscription will include a subset of the capabilities provided in the trial version. 

For more information about pricing and licensing, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).
