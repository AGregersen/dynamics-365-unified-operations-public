# Which version of Attract?

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The version of Attract that's right for you depends on your organization's size and needs. Attract Basic provides a subset of Attract's functionality geared towards smaller teams or organizations, where the hiring manager is the primary user. You can start using Attract Basic with one or more licenses.

Attract Comprehensive targets medium to large teams or organizations where the recruiter or talent specialist is the primary user. Attract Comprehensive requires the purchase of five or more licenses through a [Dynamics 365 partner](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/partners/find-a-partner/).

>[!NOTE]
>The Attract trial showcases Attract Comprehensive, which contains comprehensive recruiting and hiring capabilities. These include the ability to post jobs to an Attract career site or external recruiting site such as LinkedIn. If you choose Attract Basic, your subscription will include a subset of the capabilities provided in the trial version. 

For more information about pricing and licensing, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

>[!WARNING]
>At this time, you can't migrate data from Attract Basic to Attract Comprehensive.
