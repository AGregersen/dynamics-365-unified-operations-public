# Create and send an onboarding guide

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

With Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent: Onboard, you can create onboarding guides from templates you created on your own or from those available in the gallery. After you've created at least one onboarding guide template, you can create a guide for your new hire.

1. On the left-hand menu, select **Templates**.

2. Under **My templates**, select the template you'd like to set up as an onboarding guide for your new hire.

3. Edit the template as desired, being sure to save your work as you go.

4. When you're done editing, select **Create guide**.

5. In the **Create a guide** window, enter your new hire's name or email address under **Who are you onboarding**. If your new hire isn't in the system yet, select **Add now** and enter the employee's information.

6. Select a start date under **When do they start**. 7. If desired, select an automatic send date. If you want to send the guide immediately, turn the **Schedule an automatic send date** toggle button off. Select **Done**.

7. Select **Send** in the upper-right corner of the screen. Then do one of the following:
    - If you want to send your new hire a link to the onboarding guide on your own, select **copy a link** and then select **Copy**.
    - If you want to customize the email for the onboarding guide, select **Customize the email before sending** and then select **Next**, customize the email as desired, and select **Send**.
    - If you don't want to customize the email, select **Next** and then select **Send**.

8. If you want to send your customized guide to another new hire, select **Save as template**, enter a new template name, select **Save**, and start the process over again.

## Send on onboarding guide to multiple new hires

Onboard lets you send an onboarding guide to multiple new hires at the same time.

1. On the left-hand menu, select **Templates**.

2. Under **My templates**, select the template you'd like to set up as an onboarding guide for your new hire.

3. Edit the template as desired, being sure to save your work as you go.

4. When you're done editing, select **Create guide**.

5. In the **Create a guide** window, select **Need to onboard multiple people at once**. 

6. Select **new hire template**, click **Open** when the .xlsx file finishes downloading, enter your employees' information in the Excel spreadsheet, and save the spreadsheet.

    > You'll need to click **Enable editing** in Excel before you can edit the spreadsheet.

7. Drag and drop the Excel spreadsheet to the designated area in the **Create multiple guides** window, or click the area to browse for the file on your computer.

8. Select **Send** in the upper-right corner of the screen. Then do one of the following:
