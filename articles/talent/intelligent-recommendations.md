# Intelligent recommendations

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Machine learning can help recruiters and hiring managers quickly identify top candidates for a position. It can also help prospects find the position that best suits their profile and interests. As these features are used, and feedback is provided, recommendations will improve.

> [!NOTE] 
> - The intelligent recommendation features are available only with the Comprehensive hiring add-on.
> - To enable the candidate and job recommendation features, an admin must turn on the preview options for them. In the Admin center, on the **Feature management** tab, make sure that the **Preview features** option is set to **On**. Then make sure that the individual **Candidate recommendation**, **Job recommendation** and **Prospect recommendation** options are set to **On**.

## Candidate recommendations

Because job postings might attract hundreds of applicants, it can be difficult for recruiters and hiring managers to find the candidates whose skills and background best match the position. By analyzing the correlation between the job description and requirements, and data from the candidates' resumes and profiles, machine learning can be used to produce candidate recommendations. Candidate recommendations can help recruiters and hiring managers identify the top talent and move them to the interview stage faster. For any job, if there are more than ten candidates or prospects who have resumes or complete profiles, the candidates or prospects who most closely meet the job's requirements appear in the **Applicants to consider** section on the **Job** page.

For any recommended candidate, you can select **View candidate** on the candidate card to review the candidate's profile and take action on his or her application. You can use the ellipsis button (**...**) to open the candidate's profile on a new tab. You can also use the ellipsis button to provide feedback about the recommendation. In this way, you help fine-tune the recommendation engine and improve future recommendations. Any recommendations that you don't like are removed from the **Applicants to consider** section when you refresh the **Job** page. You can use the feedback card to indicate why you didn't find the recommendation useful.

## Job recommendations 

When a prospective employee uses the career site to apply to a job, other open positions at the organization are recommended. These recommendations are based on the prospect's past applications, and on his or her resume or candidate profile. Therefore, job recommendations help prospects quickly identify the jobs that are the best fit for them. Job recommendations are provided to prospects if more than ten jobs are posted on the career site. Prospects can open the details of a job posting from the recommendation card. They can also provide feedback about a recommendation to help improve future recommendations.

## Prospect recommendations 

Intelligent prospect recommendations 
=====================================

When a new position becomes available, looking through all your past applicants
and your entire talent network can take a while. Why not let Attract help you?
Using intelligent machine learning algorithms, we can look at all of the
candidates in Attract and for the ones who may be a good match, suggest them as
prospects as soon as you create the job. As soon as you have created a job
description and listed the required skills, we have enough information to get
you started with prospect recommendations. To see these recommendations, you
need to enable the prospects stage for the job. It may take up to a minute for
Attract to scour through your entire candidate database to make recommendations.

The recommendations will appear as cards in the Prospects tab of any job that has
the prospect stage enabled. These cards will list the skills we found in this
profile as well as any education qualification information we find. If you like
a recommendation, you can easily add the candidate as a prospect for that job.

If you’ve only recently started using Attract, you’ll need to wait until you
have 10 or more applicants who have full profiles or resumes to start making use
of this capability.

We’ve made sure we do our best to minimize bias in our recommendations. We
simply scan through candidate profiles and look for skills, qualifications and
other keywords that match the job description. Additionally, we remove
personally identifying information from candidate profiles prior to evaluating
them.
