Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent: Onboard lets you view the progress of your new hires with their onboarding activities. You can also see any tasks that have been assigned to you from onboarding guides.

## View the status of onboarding employees

1. On the left-hand menu, select **Guides**. This provides an overview of the progress for all the guides you've sent.

2. To drill down, select the guide you want to view.

3. Select **Activities** to see which activities your new hire has completed.

## View onboarding tasks assigned to you

1. On the left-hand menu, select **Tasks**. This provides an overview of all the onboarding tasks assigned to you from onboarding guides sent to employees.

2. To drill down, select the desire task. Follow up with the new hire as needed. When you've completed the task, mark it as complete by checking the circle next to it.
