# Post jobs to LinkedIn from Attract

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent: Attract helps you get the talent you need by letting you post your jobs to LinkedIn directly from Attract. After you [create a job](./creating-jobs-attract.md), all you have to do is push a button to put your job in front of thousands of potential candidates on LinkedIn.

The following table shows the actions you can perform on LinkedIn, depending on your user role.

| Your role | Actions you can take |
| --- | --- |
| Admin | post, re-post, unpost |
| Hiring manager | read only |
| Recruiter | post, re-post, unpost |
| Interviewer | no access |
| Read-only | read only |


For more information about user roles in Attract, see [Security and role management in Attract](./security-attract.md).

If you're an admin who needs more information about configuring LinkedIn integration with Attract, see [Set up integration with LinkedIn](./attract-admin-linkedin.md).

## Post jobs to LinkedIn

1. In Attract, open the job that you want to post to LinkedIn.
2. On the **Postings** tab, select the **Post Now** button that corresponds to LinkedIn.

4. Select **Done**.
5. In the **Submit for posting** window, select **Confirm**.

After LinkedIn successfully completes the posting, the **Postings** section of the job in Attract shows the LinkedIn status as **Posted**.

It can take up to 24 hours for your job to appear in LinkedIn. All job postings done with attract are Limited Listings. For more information about Limited Listings in LinkedIn, see [Limited Listings vs Premium Job Slots for Job Wrapping](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/79049).
