### Feature management workspace

Features are added and updated in every release. The Feature management experience provides a workspace where you can view a list of features that have been delivered in each release. By default, new features are turned off. You can use the workspace to turn them on and view the documentation for them.

### Preview/Mandatory features

All new features remain in preview for at least 30 days, and typically 30-60 days. Major features are generally available in October and April of each year following the preview period. As soon as you see  new capabilities in the **Feature management** workspace, you can turn them on. Some features may be on by default.
 
At times, an integral feature will be on by default without the ability to be turned off. For example, the **Feature management** feature is on by default and can't be turned off.
 
Once a feature is generally available, it may be turned on or off in production environments. Features may also reach a point where you can no longer turn them off. These are mandatory features. The **Feature management** workspace indicates when a preview feature will be made mandatory and can no longer be turned off. This is usually on October 1 or April 1 to align with the semiannual release plans. Until this time, you can turn the feature on and off in all environment.
