 ### Current balance examples
 
 #### Annual plan
 
 Plan setup:
 
| Plan start date | Enrollment date  | Accrual frequency | Accrual period basis | Accrual award date    |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
|     1/1/2018    |     1/1/2018     |       Annual      |    Plan start date   | End of accrual period |
 
Accruals are processed on **1/1/2019** (to include the entire period ). 

Results: 

| Accrual amount | Minimum balance | Maximum carry-forward | Request amount  | Current balance  (as of 1/1/2019) |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
|       200      |        0        |          120          |        40       |                160                |

Current balance (160) = Accrual amount (200) - Request amount (40)

 #### Semimonthly plan

 Plan setup:
 
| Plan start date | Enrollment date  | Accrual frequency | Accrual period basis | Accrual award date    |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
|     1/1/2018    |     2/1/2018     |    Semimonthly    |    Plan start date   | End of accrual period |
 
Accruals are processed on **5/1/2018** (to include the entire period ). 

Results: 

| Accrual amount | Minimum balance | Maximum carry-forward | Request amount  | Current balance  (as of 1/1/2019) |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
|       5        |        0        |          120          |        8        |                22                 |

Current balance (22) = Accrual amount (5*6) - Request amount (8)

#### Monthly plan

 Plan setup:
 
| Plan start date | Enrollment date  | Accrual frequency | Accrual period basis | Accrual award date    |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
|     1/1/2018    |     2/1/2018     |    Semimonthly    |    Plan start date   | End of accrual period |
 
Accruals are processed on **5/1/2018** (to include the entire period ). 

Results: 

| Accrual amount | Minimum balance | Maximum carry-forward | Request amount  | Current balance  (as of 1/1/2019) |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
|       5        |        0        |          120          |        8        |                7                  |

Current balance (7) = Accrual amount (5*3) - Request amount (8)

### Forecasted balance
 - Amount of leave available on future date that forecasts accruals and carry-forward adjustments up to that date
 - Formula:
  - Monday forecasted balance = Current balance - Request(s) + Accrual(s) - Carry-forward adjustment
