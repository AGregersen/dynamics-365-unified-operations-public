# Plan your onboarding guide

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

With Dynamics 365 for Talent: Onboard, you can create an onboarding guide for your new hires that helps them ramp up quickly and efficiently. Onboard provides many templates for you to choose from. You can start with a template or create your own onboarding guide without one.

Before beginning, it's important to understand how and where you can improve your onboarding process so you can include all necessary and helpful information in your onboarding guide. The following questions can help you analyze and improve your onboarding process:

- What is your attrition rate?
- Are new employees successfully completing all of their required onboarding tasks?
- How long does it take for a new employee to ramp up?
- How do new employees rank their satisfaction?

Acquiring this data will help you to measure the success of your new onboarding guide.

## Pre-boarding

Onboarding should actually start as soon as your new employee has a start date. Often called pre-onboarding or pre-boarding, starting the process before your employee's first day is your chance to keep new hires excited about their choice to join your company, foster relationships, and demonstrate your company's culture and values.

One of the most important pre-onboarding activities is preparing new hires for their first day of work. This can be a stressful time for them. Reduce the stress by creating a checklist and agenda for their first day.

### What to include in a checklist

- What to bring, such as a photo ID, proof of citizenship, and bank information
- Dress code, if your company has one
- Directions to your office
- The name of a contact person, or even better, a hiring buddy
- Any company handbooks or policies they should read

**Bonus**

- Send them some company swag, such a t-shirt or mug.
- Send video messages from the team welcoming them to the company.
- Include a personalized welcome from the CEO or another executive.
- Make their first day special.

## Create a good first impression

Create an agenda for the day and share it with your new hire. Rather than just focusing on orientation, make sure to have fun, introduce new hires to their colleagues, and show them around the office. Keep other employees in the loop. Let them know that someone new is joining the company. Be sure to include the people in IT, Payroll, and other administrative departments. Make sure new hires have everything they need to get started. This includes a workspace, computer, and required credentials, software, and tools. 

Focus on relationships instead of paperwork. Relationships are key to getting new hires get up to speed. More importantly, they help create a sense of community and belonging in your company.

- Find an expert or champion in your company and make them an onboarding buddy.
- Connect new hires with job-related communities or interest groups. This is a great way to find coaches or mentors.
- Share team member profiles (ideally, ahead of time) to speed up communication, knowledge sharing, and networking.
- Don't forget about social communities or events that align to your employee's personal goals.

## Provide training

Give your new hire the confidence and tools they need to be successful. This starts with clearly defining their responsibilities and setting your expectations for how they will be achieved. Next, create a training plan that focuses on the skills they need to meet your expectations.

## Set clear milestones

Set up clear checkpoints and feedback loops between you and your new hire. Create as much opportunity to intervene and course-correct as possible. You want to address issues before they become problems, or worse, lead to attrition.

Schedule a one-on-one meeting with the new employee before their first week is over. This is a great time to discuss expectations, work styles, and career growth.

Define 30-, 60-, and 90-day goals for your newest team members. When the goals are set, be sure to check in regularly to see how their progress is tracking against these goals.

## Measure and optimize

When you roll out a new onboarding program, pay careful attention to the following questions. 

- Are you improving attrition rates?
- Is satisfaction increasing among new hires? 

Measure these details and make small improvements with each new hire.
