# Troubleshoot posting jobs to LinkedIn

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Use the following information to help troubleshoot problems you might be having with posting jobs to LinkedIn from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent: Attract.

## Troubleshoot signing in to LinkedIn from Attract

If you're having trouble signing in to LinkedIn from Attract, try the following:

1. Verify that the LinkedIn credentials that you entered in Attract are valid and correct.

2. If the credentials are valid and correct, contact [LinkedIn support](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin).

3. If the issue persists, contact [Microsoft support](./talent-support.md).

## Troubleshoot job posts from Attract not appearing in LinkedIn

If your job hasn't appeared in LinkedIn after 24 hours, try the following:

1. Make sure your LinkedIn Company ID maps to your LinkedIn company page and is correctly entered in the Attract Admin center. For more information about changing LinkedIn settings in the Admin center, see [Set up integration with LinkedIn](attract-admin-linkedin.md). For more information about LinkedIn Company IDs, see [Associating your LinkedIn Company ID with the LinkedIn Job Board - Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/98972).

2. Check the job details in LinkedIn to make sure the address is complete. LinkedIn needs at least the city and country of the job to post successfully.

3. Ensure the job doesn't duplicate another job posted on LinkedIn. LinkedIn won't post jobs that are duplicates of either LinkedIn premium listings or limited listings from another source. Verify another person at your company didn't already post the job manually.
