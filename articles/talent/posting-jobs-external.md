## Post jobs to Broadbean

After Broadbean has been turned on, recruiters and admins can post a job to it. You must have an apply URL for the job.

1. In Attract, open the job that you want to post to Broadbean.
2. In the **Postings** section, select the **Post Now** button that corresponds to Broadbean.
3. Follow the instructions in the Broadbean window.

Attract passes the following information to Broadbean:

- Request ID
- Job title
- Job description
- Job location
- Apply URL
- Recruiter information

After Broadbean successfully completes the posting, the **Postings** section of the job in Attract shows the Broadbean status as **Posted**.

> - Broadbean requires the **Industry** field. Currently, this field is set to **IT** by default. However, you can change the value to the correct industry in the window for Broadbean job posting.
> - It takes some time for Broadbean to finish posting your job to all the job boards that you selected. Therefore, there might be a slight delay before Attract provides a status update for the job.
