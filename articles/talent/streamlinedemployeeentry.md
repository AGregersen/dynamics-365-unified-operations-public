# Streamlined employee entry and navigation

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 for Talent has been enhanced to allow efficient entry of employee and employment data. Work history information can be quickly updated for past, active and future employees and contractors. A simplified/consolidated navigation model is also available to quickly find related information, view and make any necessary changes.

## View options

A view option is available on the worker form to select any combination employees and contractors from a single list. The view options allow for viewing workers across legal entities or for the legal entity you are currently logged into. Other options provide viewing of Active, Pending, Exited workers and the ability to restrict based workers type: Employee or Contractor. If you have advanced security enabled you will only see those employees and contractors for the legal entities you have access to.

Columns in the list view will also change based on your selections. For example, when viewing exited employees the termination date and reason codes will be additional columns in the list.

## Navigation and Banner

A new banner will now display key information for each worker. For *Active* workers, information includes: Title, Department, Position type (Full Time), Worker type, Manager and Legal entity. Exited workers will display: Exited date and Reason and pending employees will display: Title, Department, Position type, Manager, Starting date and Legal entity.

The action pane of the worker page has been re-organized to include fewer options. Information is now organized in the following categories: Work, Person, Leave, Compensation, Benefits and Compliance. Along with the action pane changes, a new *Links* tab is avalable on the main worker page to give users a central location to access all related information for a worker.

Information may not be in the same location as before, for example: The Payroll information previously on the worker form is now available in the action pane under Compensation > Payroll and the Personal information tab now has a more information button to hide fields that are not accessed often.

## Work history

Work history (employment data) has been updated to show work history accross all legal entities and is avilable for exited, active and pending employees and contractors. You will now see in one view all work history for the *legal entities* you have access to. Along with ability to view information in a single tab, you can also edit information for each of the work history entries without changing the data context. All inforomation can be updated directly on the page.

## Position history

Position history has been "promoted" to a new tab on the main worker page, with a full view of all positons held with in the organization, past, present and any future positions assignments. Direct navigation to the workers position history can still be viewed in the action pane as well.
