# Update onboarding guides

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

If you need to make changes to onboarding guides in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent: Onboard, you can update them and push the changes, whether you've sent the guides or not. You have two options when editing an onboarding guide:

- Edit an onboarding guide directly and save it.

- Edit the onboarding template and push the changes to all guides created from it.

## Edit an onboarding guide directly

1. On the left-hand menu, select **Guides**.

2. Select the guide you'd like to change.

3. Make all desired changes and then select **Save** (the disk icon).

   ![[Save changes to onboarding guide](./media/onboard-save.png)](./media/onboard-save.png)

Onboard will automatically send the new hire an email saying what the changes are. A red **New** tag appears next to each change for easy identification.

## Edit multiple guides by editing the onboarding template

1. On the left-hand menu, select **Templates**.

2. Under **My templates**, select the template you'd like to edit.

3. Make all desired changes and then select **Save** (the disk icon).

4. To push the changes out to all the guides based on that template, select **Push these changes**.

   ![[Push changes in onboarding template to all guides created from it](./media/onboard-push-changes.png)](./media/onboard-push-changes.png)

While these changes will be visible to new hires who open the onboarding guides, Onboard does not send email alerts to new hires letting them know their onboarding guide has changed.  A red **New** tag appears next to each change for easy identification.
