## Get started with Onboard

When you start Onboard for the first time, you're invited to start a tour of the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. This is where you set up your organization, manage users,and manage your subscriptions (one of which is your Onboard subscription). For more information about the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [About the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/admin-overview/about-the-admin-center?view=o365-worldwide).

To get to the Onboard app:

1. Go to the [Microsoft sign in page](https://portal.office.com/).

2. When prompted, enter your Microsoft 365 email and password.

3. Select the app launcher icon in the upper-left and choose **Dynamics 365**.

Your first sign in might take a few minutes while the environment initializes.

## Try the walkthrough

When you first start Onboard, you can select **Start the walkthrough** to get started with a working template.

If you skip the walkthrough and want to access it at a later date, select the Help icon (**?**) and then select **Get started**.

## Change your domain name

If you accepted the default domain name (ending in **onmicrosoft.com**) when signing up with Onboard, you can change it to another domain if you prefer. 

1. Go to the [Microsoft sign in page](https://portal.office.com/).

2. When prompted, enter your Microsoft 365 email and password.

3. If you see a recommendation to add your own domain under **Recommended for you**, select **View recommendation** and follow the prompts. If you don't see that recommendation, select **Show all** in the menu on the left side, select **Setup**, select **Domains**, and then select either **Add domain** or **Buy domain**.
