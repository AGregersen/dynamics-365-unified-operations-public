# Talent updates

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent is a true software as a service (SaaS) that provides continuous, touchless service updates. These updates contain both application and platform changes that often provide critical improvements to the service, including regulatory updates.

## Update policy

Updates are released on a regular cadence to all environments. Talent is supported according to the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifecycle#gp/OSSLpolicy "Microsoft Support Lifecycle"), which provides consistent and predictable guidelines for product support availability.

## Release cadence




## Get early visibility into Talent releases

You can find out what's in the works for Talent and what we've released in the following locations:

- [Dynamics 365 Talent roadmap](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/roadmap/talent/)

- [Dynamics 365 Release Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/release-plans/)

- [What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/talent/whats-new)

- [Issue search in Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/issue-search-lcs)

## Get early access to mandatory end-user impacting features

You can validate features and capabilities in advance before they're enabled automatically. This gives you the opportunity to validate the update in your sandbox environment before it's applied to your production environment. It also lets you try out the new features in advance so you can confidently roll them out to your users.

## Preview features in a sandbox environment

We highly recommend previewing features in a sandbox or trial environment. It's best to create a copy of your current production environment or database into a sandbox environment so you can get the complete experience of the new features with your data.

For more information about provisioning a sandbox environment, see [Provision a Talent project](provisioning-talent.md#provision-a-talent-project). To remove a test environment, see [Removing a test drive environment](remove-talent-environment.md#removing-a-test-drive-environment). 

## Report bugs during early access

Please report any bugs through [Microsoft Dynamics 365 support](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/support/).
