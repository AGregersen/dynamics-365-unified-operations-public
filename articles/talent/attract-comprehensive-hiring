We are aware that different organizations value different set of functionalities
within Attract. Hence, we have 2 levels for the Attract product. We have a
Attract product that targets smaller teams or organizations where the hiring
manager is the primary user persona for the hiring process. We also have a
comprehensive hiring add-on that can be added to the Attract product, at an
additional cost, that targets medium to large teams or organizations where the
Recruiter or Talent specialist is the primary user persona for the hiring
process.
