# Cost accounting service home page

International organizations are under increasing pressure to comply with both local regulations (local GAAP) and common accounting standards (such as US-GAAP, IFRS, or IAS) even in situations were various standards and regulations may be in conflict.

International organizations that have subsidiaries in countries with a hyper fluctuating local currency may be required by the local government to account and manage inventory in that  currency. However, to comply with US-GAAP, the subsidiary is also required to account and manage inventory in a stable currency such as US Dollars (USD).

Organizations may prefer to account inventory by standard cost as part of their management accounting setup. However, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), local governments, and local tax authorities don't always recognize standard cost as an accepted method, and often require average, FIFO, or specific identification.

The cost accounting service add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management lets you account inventory in multiple ledgers, and thereby supports multiple currencies and multiple valuations.
