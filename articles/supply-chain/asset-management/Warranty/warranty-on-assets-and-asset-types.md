# Warranty on objects and object types

This topic explains how to set up warranty on objects and object types in Enterprise Asset Management.

## Set up warranty on object type

1. Click **Enterprise asset management** > **Setup** > **Object** > **Types**.

2. Select the object type to which you want to attach a warranty agreement.

3. On the **General** FastTab, select the agreement in the **Vendor warranty** field.

## Set up warranty on object

1. Click **Enterprise asset management** > **Common** > **Objects** > **All Objects**.

2. Select the object and click **Edit**.

3. On the **Vendor** FastTab, select the warranty agreement in the **Vendor warranty** section.

4. Select the start and end dates in the **Warranty start** and **Warranty end** fields.

**Caution:** If a date is selected in the Contract / warranty **Date** field on a work order, that is the date from which the warranty or contract is valid for the work order. When you create a work order, the date of creation is automatically inserted in this field. You can change the date in this field to, for example, correspond with the start date in a warranty agreement.

The figure below shows a screenshot of the interface.
