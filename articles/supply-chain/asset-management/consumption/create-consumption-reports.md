# Create consumption reports

When you've created and posted consumption registrations on work orders in Asset Management, two reports are available to display consumption details.


## Asset consumption report

When you have posted consumption on work orders, you can print an asset consumption report. The report displays hours, hour costs, item costs, and expenses posted on assets.

1. Click **Asset management** > **Reports** > **Assets** > **Asset consumption**.

2. In the **Asset consumption** dialog, select the parameters and detail level you want to see by selecting the relevant check boxes ad functional location level in the **Show** section.

3. Select a date interval in the **Dates** section.

4. On the **Destination** FastTab, select if you want to display the report on screen, print it, or save it as a file.

4. If required, you can select specific assets to be displayed in the report. On the **Records to include** FastTab, click **Filter**, and add the assets you want to include in the report.

5. Click **OK** to generate the report.


## Work order consumption report

When you have posted consumption on work orders, you can print a work order consumption report. The report displays hours, hour costs, item costs, and expenses posted on work orders.

1. Click **Asset management** > **Reports** > **Work orders** > **Work order consumption**.

2. Select the parameters you want to include in the report by selecting the the relevant check boxes in the **Show** section.

3. Select the date interval in the **Dates** section.

4. If required, you can select specific work orders to be displayed in the report. On the **Records to include** FastTab, click **Filter**, and add the work orders you want to include in the report.

5. Click **OK** to generate the report.

>[!NOTE]
>You can also generate a [work order report](../work-orders/work-order-report.md), which contains more work order details.
