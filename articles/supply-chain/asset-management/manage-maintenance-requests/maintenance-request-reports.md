# Maintenance request reports


In Asset Management, you can generate two reports regarding maintenance requests, one displaying details, and one providing a list to be used for planning and follow-up.

## Create maintenance request details report

You can create a detailed report for maintenance requests that shows various information related to the request.

1. Click **Asset management** > **Reports** > **Maintenance requests** > **Maintenance request details**.
2. On the **Records to include** FastTab, you can select specific maintenance requests to be included in the report.
3. If required, you can set up report generation as a batch job by filling out the fields on the **Run in the background** FastTab.
4. Click **OK** to generate the report.

Below you see an example of a maintenance request details report.

## Create maintenance request list report

You can create a maintenance request list report displaying a list of all maintenance requests using the same request type.

1. Click **Asset management** > **Reports** > **Maintenance requests** > **Maintenance request list**.
2. On the **Records to include** FastTab, you can make selections to be included in the report.
3. If required, you can set up report generation as a batch job by filling out the fields on the **Run in the background** FastTab.
4. Click **OK** to generate the report.

Below you see an example of a maintenance request list report for all active maintenance requests.
