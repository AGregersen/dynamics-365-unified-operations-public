# Request reports



This topic explains how to request reports. In Enterprise Asset Management, you can generate two reports regarding requests, one displaying details, and one providing a list to be used for planning and follow-up.

## Create request details report

You can create a detailed report for requests that shows various information related to the request.

1. Click **Enterprise asset management** > **Reports** > **Requests** > **Request details**.
2. On the **Records to include** FastTab, you can select specific requests to be included in the report.
3. If required, you can set up report generation as a batch job by filling out the fields on the **Run in the background** FastTab.
4. Click **OK** to generate the report.

Below you see an example of a request details report.

You can create a request list report displaying a list of all requests using the
same request type.

1. Click **Enterprise asset management** > **Reports** > **Requests** > **Request list**.
2. On the **Records to include** FastTab, you can make selections to be included in the report.
3. If required, you can set up report generation as a batch job by filling out the fields on the **Run in the background** FastTab.
4. Click **OK** to generate the report.
