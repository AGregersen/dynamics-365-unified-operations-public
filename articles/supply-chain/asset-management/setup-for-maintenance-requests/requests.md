# Maintenance requests

Maintenance Requests are used to create a request indicating that a work order may be required for a specific job. A Maintenance request can be any user having access to Dynamics 365 for Finance & Operations Asset Management functionality. A planner or manager can then decide whether the request should be converted to a work order or it should complete its own lifecycle. You can set up different request types to be used in your company, for example, maintenance requests.

## All maintenance requests

Click **Asset management** > **Common** > **Maintenance requests** > **All maintenance requests** or **Active maintenance requests** to open the list. **All maintenance requests** contain a list of all requests, regardless of the maintenance request stage. The following image shows a screenshot of the interface.
