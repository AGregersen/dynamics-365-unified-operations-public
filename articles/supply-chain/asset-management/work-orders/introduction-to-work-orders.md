# Introduction to work orders

Work orders are used to manage, provide required information for, and register consumption on maintenance jobs. A work order may contain one or more work order jobs, and one or more assets can be connected to a work order. Each work order line defines a maintenance job scheduled on the asset.

Work orders can be created automatically or manually:

- Automatically using the **Schedule maintenance plans** form, for calendar-based maintenance plans set to "Auto create" (refer to [Preventive and reactive maintenance](../preventive-and-reactive-maintenance/preventive-maintenance-overview.md)).  

- Automatically using the **Schedule maintenance rounds** form, for maintenance rounds set to "Auto create" (refer to [Preventive and reactive maintenance](../preventive-and-reactive-maintenance/preventive-maintenance-overview.md)).  

- Create from maintenance schedule (refer to the [Maintenance schedule](../preventive-and-reactive-maintenance/object-calendar.md) section), which can be preventive maintenance jobs or maintenance requests.  

- Create a work order manually.  

- Create a work order from the **All maintenance requests** or **Active maintenance requests** or **My functional location maintenance requests**.

>[!NOTE]
>Work order jobs related to the same asset are related to the same project ID.

## All work orders

Click **Asset management** > **Common** > **Work orders** > **All Work orders** to open the list. **All work orders** contain a list of all work orders and displays some of the information related to a work order.

- Click **Asset management** > **Common** > **Work orders** > **Active work orders** to see a list of active work orders.

- Click **Asset management** > **Common** > **Work orders** > **My functional location work order maintenance jobs** to see a list of work order jobs containing assets installed on functional locations, you are related to as a worker (set up in [Maintenance workers and worker groups](../setup-for-objects/workers-and-worker-groups.md)).

- In the **All Work orders** list (grid view), click on a link in the **Work order** column to show the Details view of the selected record. Click the **Edit** button to open for editing.  

- In the Details view, you see detailed information related to the work order.  

- In the Details view, select the **Lines** link to see work order job details, or select the **Header** link to see work order details.  

- The vertical **Related information** pane to the right of the screen contains additional work order-related information. Expand the pane to see related information for the selected work order.

The action pane buttons are organized in tabs on the action pane. Here is a brief description of the buttons relating to Enterprise Asset Management:
