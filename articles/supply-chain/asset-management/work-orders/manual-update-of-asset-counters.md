# Manual update of asset counters

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

 


Counters are used to create registrations on an asset regarding, for example, number of hours in operation, or the number of quantities produced.

If the counter type selected for a counter is set to inherit counter values (**Asset management** > **Setup** > **Asset types** > **Counters** > **General** FastTab > **Inherit asset counter values** toggle button set to "Yes"), then, when you create a new counter line of that type, every child asset that uses the same counter type is automatically updated.

In **All assets**, you create hours or quantity counter registrations on an asset, based on your readings on the asset.

1. Click **Asset management** > **Common** > **Assets** > **All assets**.

2. Select the asset in the list, and click **Counters**. In the **Asset counters** form, you see a list of all previous counter registrations on the selected asset.

3. Click **New** to create a new registration. The asset ID is automatically inserted.

4. In the **Counter** field, select the relevant counter. Only counters related to the asset type selected on the asset are available. The related unit is automatically inserted in the **Unit** field.

5. Select date and time for the counter registration.

6. In the **Value** field, insert the number since the last counter registration, or, in the **Aggregated value** field, insert the total count number.

- If you physically install a new counter on an asset, you need to register the change on the asset in **Asset counters**. Next, you must create two registration lines with identical timestamps, and on the line regarding the new counter, you select the **Counter reset** check box. When you create the two registration lines, the first line must be for the counter that you are replacing. In the **Totals** field, the total count number is the sum of the counter total of all registered values on that counter type.  
- If the **Counter reset** check box is selected on an asset using a maintenance plan with a "Once from..." or "Once reached..." interval type, the counter is still active on the new counter line because you create a separate counter line and start over with a new counter.

If you need to make counter registrations on several assets, that can be done in **Asset management** > **Inquiries** > **Assets** > **Asset counters**.

>[!NOTE]
>You can set up a range to define deviations in manual counter registrations, and the type of message that should be displayed if registrations are outside the defined range. Refer to the [Counters](../setup-for-objects/counters.md) topic regarding setup of counters.
