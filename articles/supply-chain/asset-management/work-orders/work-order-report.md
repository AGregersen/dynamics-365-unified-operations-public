# Work order report

You can generate a work order report that shows detailed information about a work order. It is possible to select one or several work orders to be displayed in the report.

1. Click **Enterprise asset management** > **Reports** > **Work orders** > **Work order report**.

2. Select "Yes"/"No" on the toggle buttons and fill out fields in the **Parameters** section, as required, to determine the details to be included in the report.  
  a. In the **Print settings** section, you can select if you want to include attachments from the related job type setup in the print. Double-sided print is also available.

3. On the **Records to include** FastTab, you can filter the contents of the report by **Work order**.

4. If required, you can set up work order report generation as a batch job by filling out the fields on the **Run in the background** FastTab.

5. Click **OK** to generate the report.

Below you see an example of how parameters can be set up, and the related work order report.
