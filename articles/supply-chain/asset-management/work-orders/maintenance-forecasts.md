# Maintenance forecasts


When you create a work order, you create work order jobs with related assets and maintenance job types. When you select a maintenance job type containing maintenance forecasts, the forecasts are automatically copied to the work order.

You may be able to add or delete forecast lines on a work order. The setup of a work order lifecycle state, the related project type, and the stage rules related to the project type determines if you are able to add or edit forecast lines. Read more about work order lifecycle states and related project stages in [Integration to project management and accounting](../integration-to-project-management-and-accounting/forecasts-work-orders-and-projects.md).

1. Click **Asset management** > **Common** > **Work orders** > **All work orders** or **Active work orders**.

2. Select the work order in the list, and click **Forecast**. In **Work order maintenance forecast**, forecast lines from the maintenance job type selected on the work order job are displayed.


## Add hours forecast to a work order

1. Select the work order job to which you want to add a forecast.

2. On the **Hours** FastTab, click **Add** to create a new line.

3. Select a category in the **Category** field.

4. Insert number of forecasted hours in the **Hours** field.

5. In the **Line property** field, select the charge type to be used on the line.


## Add items forecast to a work order

There are three ways to add items to a work order maintenance forecast: You can create lines for items (spare parts) that are not included in the spare parts list or asset BOM, you can select spare parts from the approved spare parts list, and you can select items from the asset BOM.

1. Select the work order job to which you want to add a forecast.

2. Select the **Items** FastTab.

3. Click **Add** to create a new line for a spare part that is not on the spare parts list or the asset BOM list.

4. Select the item in the **Item number** field.

5. Insert quantity in the **Sales quantity** field, and select a quantity unit in the **Unit** field.

6. Insert cost price and currency in the relevant fields, and select a **Line property**.

7. If you want to change the list of dimensions displayed on the item lines, click **Inventory** > **Display dimensions**, select the dimensions, and select "Yes" on the **Save setup** toggle button.

8. If you want to add an approved spare part to the maintenance forecast, click **Add spare parts**, select the spare part, edit related information if required, and click **OK**.

9. If you want to add asset BOM items to the forecast, click **Add BOM items**, select the item, edit related information if required, and click **OK**.

10. Click **Item where used** if you want to get an overview of where the item on the selected line is used in Asset Management in relation to assets, maintenance job type defaults, spare parts, and work orders. Read more about this overview in [Items where used](../controlling-and-reporting/items-where-used.md).


## Add expense forecast to a work order

1. This topic explains how to add an expense forecast to a work order. In the left-hand side of the form, select the work order job to which you want to add a forecast.

2. Select the **Expense** FastTab.

3. Click **Add** to create a new line.

4. Select a category in the **Category** field.

5. Insert quantity in the **Quantity** field.

6. Insert cost price, sales currency, and sales price in the relevant fields.

>[!NOTE]

## Automatic update of work order forecasts

In Asset Management, you can automatically update any changes in work order forecasts regarding hour costs, item costs, and expenses, which have been updated in other modules in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. This is done to ensure that the latest cost prices are always used in your work order forecasts. It is also possible to make similar updates for [maintenance job type forecasts](../setup-for-work-orders/job-groups-and-job-types-variants-trades-and-checklists.md).

1. Click **Asset management** > **Periodic** > **Forecast** > **Update work order forecast**.

2. In the **Update work order forecast** drop-down dialog, you can add selections regarding specific work orders or work order jobs, if required. Click **Filter** to make those selections.

3. If required, you can set up the automatic update as a batch job on the **Run in the background** FastTab.

4. Click **OK** to start the forecast update.
