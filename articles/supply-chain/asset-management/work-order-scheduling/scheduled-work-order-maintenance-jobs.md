# Work order calendar

This topic explains the work order calendar in Enterprise Asset Management. The **Work order calendar** list is used to get an overview of the work orders allocated to a resource. Work orders using resource types "Human resources", "Tools", and "Machines" are displayed in the list. The list can be used to get an overview of work orders allocated to a specific resource. You can also use it to quickly find a work order allocated to a worker who, for example, called in sick this morning, and then quickly allocate another worker to the job.

## View work order calendar

1. Click **Enterprise asset management** > **Common** > **Work orders** > **Work order calendar**.

2. You will see a list of all work orders set to stage "Scheduled" or "In progress".

3. You can sort the list, for example, by worker. You can also use the filter at the top of the list page to limit the list to display work orders allocated to a specific resource or worker.

4. You can see notes on the work order and, if required, add new notes by selecting the work order line in the list and clicking **Notes**.

5. If you want to allocate one worker to a work order, select the work order in the list, and click **Schedule exclusively**.

>[!NOTE]
>Read more about scheduling several work orders or one work order in [Schedule work orders](../work-order-scheduling/schedule-work-orders.md) and [Schedule exclusively](../work-order-scheduling/scheduling-exclusively.md).

The figure below shows a screenshot of the interface.
