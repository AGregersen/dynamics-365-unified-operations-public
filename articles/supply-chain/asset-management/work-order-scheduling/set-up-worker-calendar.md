# Set up worker calendar

This topic explains how to set up a worker calendar in Enterprise Asset Management. When you schedule work orders, you create a schedule for workers, tools, and objects. In order to carry out scheduling on workers, a calendar is related to each worker. Workers are related to a resource, and resources have calendars defined along with the possibility of creating calendar deviations, if required. The resource and calendar related to a worker is shown in **Enterprise asset management** > **Setup** > **Workers** > **Workers**.

The following figure shows a screenshot of the interface.

Calendar setup for tools and objects is not needed in relation to work order scheduling. The assumption is that tools and objects are available 24 hours a day for maintenance.
