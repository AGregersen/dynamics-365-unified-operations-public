# Set up worker calendar

When you schedule work orders, you create a schedule for maintenance workers, tools, and assets. In order to carry out scheduling on maintenance workers, a calendar is related to each maintenance worker. Maintenance workers are related to a resource, and working time calendars are set up on resoures. You set up the resource and calendar related to a worker in **Asset management** > **Setup** > **Workers** > **Workers**.


............ which are described in the [Create functional locations](../functional-locations/create-functional-locations.md)


The following figure shows a screenshot of the interface. The screenshot below shows an example of a maintenance worker who is related to a resource that uses the working time calendar "Production".

Calendar setup for tools and objects is not needed in relation to work order scheduling. The assumption is that tools and objects are available 24 hours a day for maintenance.
