# IoT intelligence core insights

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]


Internet of things (IoT) Intelligence supports the following core insights and action scenarios:

+ **Delayed orders** : Provides notification services and actions for managing delayed production orders. Displays impacted operations. Provides users with the ability to define order-delay metrics for combinations of resources and products, and notifies users when exceptions to these thresholds occur. Enables users to take relevant business actions for delayed orders, including the ability to view impact or create a maintenance request.
+ **Equipment down**: Provides notification services and actions for managing equipment-down scenarios. Displays impacted operations. Provides users with the ability to define metrics for machine-down thresholds and notifies users when an exception to these thresholds occurs. Enables users to take relevant business actions for delayed orders, including the ability to view impact or create a maintenance work order.
+ **Quality anomaly**: Provides notification services and actions for managing quality anomalies. Provides users with the ability to define quality attributes for products and get notified when exceptions to these attributes occur.

You can setup and configure core insights without writing any code. 

In this topic, you will configure the scenario to generate a message in Supply Chain Management when a machine goes down. This is the **Equipment down** scenario.

## Overview of setup process

+ Configure your devices to send telemetry to IoT Hub, and define the JSON message format. For more information, see [Azure IoT Hub Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/).
+ Create a OneBox environment, and give the appropriate SQL users access to environment for IoT Intelligence.
+ Setup the IoT scenario in Supply Chain Management, including enabling the feature flag, configuring the schema, mapping the signals to Suppy Chain Management sources, and enabling the scenario.

## Azure Resource setup

+ Add the **Microsoft Dynamics Microservice ERP** **First Party App Id** to the customer tenant.
+ Setup an Azure Redis Cache for IoT Intelligence.
    + Show where the Redis Cache connection string is located.        
    + Call out that it is recommendation that only one Redis Cache is used per environment.
+ Setup an Azure IoT Hub for IoT Intelligence.
    + Add the IoT Intelligence consumer groups.       
    + Show where the Event Hub connection string is located.     
    + Call out that it is recommendation that only one IoT Hub is used per environment
        
### How to setup an Azure Key Vault for IoT Intelligence

+ Give the first party app-id the correct Access Policies to the key vault.     
+ Show where the Key Vault Uri is located.
+ Show where the Key Vault ADD tenant id is located.
+ Add the IoT Hub connection string to the key vault.      
+ Add the Redis Cache connection string to the key vault.    
+ Show where the Key Vault secret names are located.  
+ Call out that any time one of the connection strings is updated the secret values will need to be updated

Notes:

+ You must add the Microsoft Dynamics microservice, first party app ID.
+ You must give the LCS environment access to the key vault.


## LCS Environment setup 

1. Open LCS.
2. Navigate to the environment details.
3. Scroll down to an environment.
4. In the Add-in section, click **Install a new add-in** to populate the list of addins that have been enabled for the environment.
5. Click on the **IoT Intelligence** add-in.
6. Provide the details of your IoT hub and Redis cache. You can find the values that you need in the key vault you created in the [name of section](#link to section).

    1. In Azure, open the key vault you previously created, and copy the DNS name. The DNS name servers as the key vault identifer.
    2. In the **Setup add-in** dialog, paste the value into the fields for **IoT Hub** and **Redis cache**.
    3. In Azure, open the key vault and click the Secrets tab. Copy the secret for ?? and copy it to the ??? field in the **Setup add-in** dialog.
    4. In Azure, copy the secret for the **Redis ???** and copy it to **Redis cache endpoint secret name** in the **Setup add-in** dialog.

7. Click **Install**. 
8. A dialog shows up that says **Add-in has been successfully triggered for installation**. Click **OK**.

## Configure the **Equipment downtime** scenario in Supply Chain Management

The **Equipment downtime** scenario maps a machine to a **PartOut** signal and defines an alert threshold. The machine is monitored only when the machine is selected for the scenario and is set to running in Supply Chain Management. If the time since the machineâ€™s last received Part Out signal is greater than the alert threshold, then a **Machine down** notification is triggered. If the machine is still running, when the next **PartOut** signal is received a **Machine up** notification is triggered. If a machine stays down for 30 mins a new **Machine down** notification is triggered.

1. Log into the Finance and Operations apps.
2. Enbale the IoT Intelligence feature flag. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).
3. Switch the **USMF** (for demo data).
4. Navigate to **Production control**.
5. Navigate to **Setup \> IoT Intelligence \> Scenario parameters**. Enter the Redis connection string. *Insert instructions here on how to get this value. It appears not to be in the key vault.*
6. Navigate to **Setup \> IoT Intelligence \> Scenario management**.
7. Click **Configure** on the **Equipment downtime** tile. This starts the configuration wizard for the **Equipment sensor schema definition**. The goal here is to setup the schema in Supply Chain Management to match the JSON format that you created when you setup the message in Azure. In this example, the message payload contains a batch of messages with this format:

    ```json
    {
        "timestamp": 1576016821614,
        "payload": [
            {
                "id": "IoTInt.Machine1225.PartOut",
                "timestamp": 1576016821614,
                "value": True
            },
            {
                "id": "IoTInt.Machine1226.PartOut",
                "timestamp": 1576016991616,
                "value": True
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

8. Add a row to the table. 

    1. Set the **Schema name** to **id**.
    2. Set the **Schema path** to **/[payload]\*/id**.
    3. Set the **Description** to **Message id**.

9. Add a row to the table. 

    1. Set the **Schema name** to **timestamp**.
    2. Set the **Schema path** to **/[payload]\*/timestamp**.
    3. Set the **Description** to **Message timestamp**.

10. Add a row to the table. 

    1. Set the **Schema name** to **value**.
    2. Set the **Schema path** to **/[payload]\*/value**.
    3. Set the **Description** to **Message value**.

    You don't need to define all the properties in the message, only the ones that you need. In this example, you did not create a row for **Root timestamp**.
  
11. If there are sample entries in the table, delete them.
12. Click **Next** to go to the **Equipment sensor schema map** page.
13. In the row for **Equipment resource id** set the **Schema name** to **id**. The valid values are displayed in a dropdown table.
14. In the row for **UTC time** set the **Schema name** to **Timestamp**. The valid values are displayed in a dropdown table.
15. In the row for **Part produced signal** set the **Schema name** to **value**. The valid values are displayed in a dropdown table.
16. Click **Next** for the **Equipment resource id configuration** page.
17. In this step, you map the machine names to ??? in the Supply Chain Management. 

    1. For the **Schema path** - **/[payload]\*/id**, in the **Signal Data Values** table, add a new row, and enter **IoTInt.Machine1225.PartOut** in the **Value** column. 
    2. In the **Business Record Mapping** table, click **New**. The default value for the **Business record type** is autopopulated, and you don't need to change it. 
    3. In the **Business record** column, select **Machine1225**. 
    4. Click **Save**. 
    5. Repeat these steps, adding a new business record mapping for **Machine1226**. You can map multiple **id** values from the messages to a single record in Supply Chain Management, but you can't map a single **id** value to multiple records in Supply Chain Management.

18. After you have entered all the rows you need in the **Business Record Mapping** table, use the **Selected** column to choose when machines you want to process. You do not have to process information that comes from all the machines.
19. Click **Next** to go to the **Part produced signal configuration** page.
20. In the **Signal Data Values** table, add a row, and set **Value** to **True**. Add another row, and set **Value** to 1. Click **Save**.
21. Click **Next** to go to the **Equipment downtime threshold** page. The values for downtime threshold are already mapped according to the machine id. In this step, you define a threshold to determine if a machine is down. For example, if you set the threshold to 10, Supply Chain Management generates a notification if there is no PartOut message from a machine after 10 minutes. 
22. Click **Next** to go to the **Enable scenario** page. Click the slider to enable the scenario.
23. Click **Finish**.

At this point, the pipeline is complete and the messages are processed automatically.


## Configure the **Quality** scenario in Supply Chain Management

The **Quality** scenario generates a notification if an attribute of an item is outside a speicified range. For example, a sensor could send the weight of each item to IoT Hub. In Suppy Chain Management, a notification would be generated if the item was too heavy or too light. 

## Configure the **Production Order Delay** scenario in Supply Chain Management

The **Production Order Delay** scenario generates a notification if the production throughput falls below a threshold value. In this scenario, a **PartOut** signal is sent to IoT Hub for each item produced. In Supply Chain Management, the order delay is calculated based on how long the production order is scheduled to run, how many items should be be produced, how long the job has been running, and how many **PartOut** signals are received. A delay notification would be generated if the number of the **PartOut** signals for the job falls below the threshold value of the expected value.

## How to view the monitors in Supply Chain Management

There are several ways to view the messages processed in the scenario in Supply Chain Management:

+ **Production control \> Inquiries and reports \> IoT Intelligence \> Notifications**. Here you can see the list of unresolved notifications. A notification is generated when a machine is down.
+ **Production control \> Inquiries and reports \> IoT Intelligence \> Closed notifications**. Here you can see the notifications that have been resolved.
+ **Production control \> Inquiries and reports \> IoT Intelligence \> Metric keys**. Here you can see a times series graph for each machine you are processing.
+ **Production control \> Manufacturing execution \> Resource status**. You can configure this page to track specific machines using the **Configure** dialog. As messages are processed a graph is produced showing the parts produced. This page displays an error message if a machine is down, and there are buttons to resolve or dismiss the error message.
+ **Production control \> Setup \> IoT Intelligence \> Scenario parameters**. Click **Equipment downtime** to see all the machines that are available.

## How to uninstall the addin

1. In Supply Chain Management, run the **Equipment downtime** configuration wizard, and disable the scenario.
2. In LCS, uninstall the addin.
