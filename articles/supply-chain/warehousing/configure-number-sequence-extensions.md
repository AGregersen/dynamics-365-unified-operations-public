# Released in version 10.0.2

# About

This functionality offers alternative approach to label printing in Microsoft Dynamics D365 by introducing new wave step method. The new method enables creating and printing of the labels directly from the wave template during wave execution process. Therefore, the labels will be available before the work order is executed on the mobile device. This handles scenarios where different approach to label handling is desirable, enabling the worker to use and attach the required labels during picking and not only after picking.

This functionality has been enhanced in 10.0.2 release with the following functionalities:
- Allow for BOL (Bill of lading) ID to be generated in advance
- Allow unique SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code) number sequence generation
- Allow for creation of GS1 compliant number sequence for BOL and SSCC numbers (support for License plate ID, Container ID, Wave label ID, Bill of lading ID out of the box)

These amendments will make it more efficient to support labelling of cartons, as well as adjust new numbers generated by the system.

# Setup

## Number sequence extensions

Number sequence extension controls GS1 compliance of specific number sequences:

- A new column was added to the “Number sequences” Tab in Warehouse management parameters where you can select the extension. Out of the box it is available only for the following references:
 - License plate ID
 - Wave label ID
 - Container ID
 - Bill of lading ID
- GS1 prefix is not a constant but always comes from the Parameters. So, updating this setup will impact all number sequences using extensions with it included
- License plate ID rules will remain As Is if no extension is configured, and overridden with new rules if an extension is configured there
- Extension segments description:
 - GS1 prefix: GS1 prefix in Warehouse management parameters
 - Application identifier: 00 for SSCC, for example, 420 for BOL, numeric value
 - New number for the Number sequence specified
 - Packing type: field from Unit sequence group lines or 0 as default (current LP logic)
 - Check digit: Modulo 10 calculation

1. Go to **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Warehouse management parameters** and enter a value in **GS1 company prefix** (your company’s GS1-prefix).

2. Go to **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Warehouse management parameters** \> **Reports** and activate checkbox **“Generate Bill of lading number when printing wave labels”**.

3. Go to **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Number sequence extensions**

4. Click **“Create default setup”**. It covers 3 variants of SSCC number generation and 1 variant of GS1-compliant BOL number sequence.

**OR**

You can also create the following setups manually:

4. Create a new record.

- Number sequence extension: SSCC-18
- Description: SSCC without application identifier

5. In the **Segments** FastTab, add new segments:

-	Packing type
- GS1 prefix
- Number sequence (make sure the length is 16 minus GS1 prefix length)
- Check digit

6. Create a new record:

- Number sequence extension: BOL
- Description: Bill of lading ID

7. In the **Segments** FastTab, add new segments:

-	GS1 prefix
-	Number sequence (make sure the length is 16 minus GS1 prefix length)
-	Check digit

8. Go to **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Warehouse management parameters** \> **Number sequences** and select **Extension ID** on an appropriate **SSCC-18 number** sequence (**License plate ID**, **Wave label ID**, **Container ID**) and **Bill of lading ID** (**BOL**).
