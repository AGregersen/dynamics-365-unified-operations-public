# Configure shipment consolidation policies

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

*Released in version 10.0.3*

The shipment consolidation process using shipment consolidation policies allows for automated shipment consolidation during automated and manual release to warehouse. After the feature is enabled, initial configuration of policies has to be done. If not configured at all, each sales line will generate a separate shipment with a single load line.

Scenarios below describe how to set up default and custom shipment consolidation policies.

## Scenario 1: Configure default shipment consolidation policies

There are two potential cases where you activate the feature and have to configure the minimum number of default policies: setting up a completely new environment and upgrading environment with data in it. For example sake, both scenarios are described assuming you use **Contoso** demo data and **USMF** company. So, the second case includes a step where you have to set the **Consolidate shipment at release to warehouse** option to **Yes** on one or more warehouses before enabling the feature.

### Default policies setup – new environment

To set up default shipment consolidation policies on a brand new environment, follow steps below. This assumes that the **Consolidate shipments** feature is already enabled in the **Feature management** workspace.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Release to warehouse \> Shipment consolidation policies**.
2. Click **Create default setup**.
    1. A **Default** policy will be created for **Sales orders** policy type.
    2. A **Default** policy will be created for **Transfer orders** policy type.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Both policies will have the same set of fields taken into consideration by legacy logic, including order number (consolidate lines into shipments based on order number, warehouse, mode of delivery, address, etc.).

### Default policies setup – upgrading an environment with warehouses already configured for cross-order consolidation

To set up default shipment consolidation policies on an environment where warehouses have been already configured for cross-order consolidation, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Warehouse \> Warehouses**.
2. In the list, find and select the desired warehouse record.
3. Click **Edit**.
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, set the **Consolidate shipment at release to warehouse** option to **Yes**.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for all warehouses where consolidation is needed.
6. Close the page.
7. Enable the **Consolidate shipments** feature in the **Feature management** workspace.
8. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Release to warehouse \> Shipment consolidation policies**.
9. Click **Create default setup**.
    1. A **CrossOrder** policy will be created for **Sales orders** policy type.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The **CrossOrder** policy will have the same set of fields taken into consideration by legacy logic, excluding order number (consolidate lines into shipments based on warehouse, mode of delivery, address, etc.)

    2. A **Default** policy will be created for **Sales orders** policy type.
    3. A **Default** policy will be created for **Transfer orders** policy type.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Both **Default** policies will have the same set of fields taken into consideration by legacy logic, including order number (consolidate lines into shipments based on order number, warehouse, mode of delivery, address, etc.).

10. Select **CrossOrder** policy and click **Edit query**.
    - In the list, note that warehouses with the **Consolidate shipment at release to warehouse** set to **Yes** were included in the query.

## Scenario 2: Configure custom shipment consolidation policies

This scenario assumes that the company has complex business requirements, and shipment consolidation has to depend on several conditions. The following examples include a short description of the business case and are supposed to be set up in a sequence that ensures the "pyramid-like" evaluation of the queries (the policies with most conditions should be evaluated with a higher priority).

The master data needed to filtering is described first, and is a precondition for processing scenarios referenced here: [Consolidate shipments](../warehousing/consolidate-shipments.md).

### Product filter codes

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Product filters \> Product filters** and create two  filter codes of **Code 4** filter title.
    1. For example, **Flammable** and **Explosive**.

2. Go to **Product information management \> Products \> Released products** and set up two WHS-enabled itemsб one item with **Flammable** product filter code (**Code 4** field on the **Warehouse** FastTab) and another one with **Explosive** product filter code.

### Mode of delivery

1. Go to **Sales and marketing \> Setup \> Distribution \> Modes of delivery** and create a mode of delivery that is different from a default mode of delivery used by the customer.
    1. For example, customer **US-001**, default mode of delivery is **10**, another mode of delivery would be **Air**.

### Order pool

1. Go to **Sales and marketing \> Setup \> Sales orders \> Order pools** and create a new order pool that will be used for consolidation query.
    1. For example, **ShipCons**.

2. Go to **Sales and marketing \> Customers \> All customers** and assign new pool to **US-003** and **US-004** customers on the **Sales order defaults** FastTab.

### Shipment consolidation policies

This setup assumes that Scenario 1 described above has been already executed.

#### Add Policy 1

Example of a business case:

- “Customer+Mode” policy
  - Query: Specific Customer account, specific Transportation mode of delivery “Air”
  - Consolidation with open shipments is off
  - Consolidation is per order id (separate shipments per order, warehouse, etc.)

To create a shipment consolidation policy that covers mentioned above business case, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Release to warehouse \> Shipment consolidation policies**.
1. Click **New**.
1. In the **Policy name** field, type a value, for example, **CustomerMode**.
1. In the **Policy description** field, type a value, for example, **Customer account and mode of delivery**.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Expand the **Consolidation fields** FastTab
1. In the list of **Remaining fields**, find and select **Mode of delivery** record (where **Field name** = Mode of delivery).
1. Click ![forward arrow](media/forward-button.png) button to move the record under **Selected fields**.
1. Click **Edit query**.
1. In the list, find and select the **Customer account** record.
1. In the **Criteria** field, enter or select a value, for example, **US-001**.
1. In the list, find or add the **Sales order lines.Mode of delivery** record.
1. In the **Criteria** field, enter or select a value, for example, **Air**.
1. Click **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> All order lines with the specified mode of delivery **Air** of customer **US-001** will not be consolidated across orders. This is used as a first sequence in case we consolidate shipments for all other modes of delivery for this customer.

#### Add Policy 2

Example of a business case:

- “Hazardous goods” policy
  - Query: Specific “hazardous” filter code, specific Transportation modes of delivery “Air, Sea”
  - Consolidation with open shipments is on
  - Consolidation is across orders (separate shipments per account, warehouse, etc. but within the item group specified in the query)

To create a shipment consolidation policy that covers mentioned above business case, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Release to warehouse \> Shipment consolidation policies**.
1. Click **New**.
1. In the **Policy name** field, type a value, for example, **Item type**.
1. In the **Policy description** field, type a value, for example **Consolidate the same type of item across orders**.
1. Click **Save**.
1. In the list of **Remaining fields**, find and select **Mode of delivery** record.
1. Click ![forward arrow](media/forward-button.png) button.
1. Select **Yes** in the **Consolidate with open shipments** field.
1. Click **Edit query**.
1. Click the **Joins** tab.
1. In the tree, expand and select **Tables\Load details**.
1. Click **Add table join**.
1. In the list, find and select **Warehouse item number (Item number)**.
1. Click **Select**.
1. Click the **Range** tab.
1. Click **Add**.
1. Add a record for a filter code from Warehouse items, for example **Warehouse item number.Code 4**.
    1. Any other grouping value can be used.
1. In the **Criteria** field, enter or select a value, for example **Flammable**.
1. Click **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> All order lines where items have the same Filter code 4, for example “Flammable”, will be consolidated across orders with other items of the same kind. If there is an open shipment for the same account, warehouse, and group of items, the new lines will be attached to it.

#### Add Policy 3

Example of a business case.

- Customer's' requirements policy
  - Query: Specific Customer account
  - Consolidation with open shipments is on
  - Consolidation is across orders but based on Customer requisition (multiple orders are grouped into shipments based on the same Customer requisition number and warehouse)

To create a shipment consolidation policy that covers mentioned above business case, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Release to warehouse \> Shipment consolidation policies**.
1. Click **New**.
1. In the **Policy name** field, type a value, for example **CustomerOrderNo**.
1. In the **Policy description** field, type a value, for example **Consolidate lines based on customer PO**.
1. Select **Yes** in the **Consolidate with open shipments** field.
1. Click **Save**.
1. In the list of **Remaining fields**, find and select the **Customer requisition** record.
1. Click ![forward arrow](media/forward-button.png) button.
1. In the list of **Remaining fields**, find and select the **Mode of delivery** record.
1. Click ![forward arrow](media/forward-button.png) button.
1. Click **Edit query**.
1. In the list, find and select the **Customer account** record.
1. In the **Criteria** field, enter or select a value, for example, **US-001**.
1. Click **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> All order lines where sales orders have the same Customer requisition number (which is used as the customer’s PO number) will be consolidated into one shipment regardless of Sales order number. If there is an open shipment for the same account, warehouse, and customer requisition, the new lines will be attached to it. It can be used if the customer sends additional order lines with the same PO number several times a day and wants them all to be grouped in one shipment (resulting in one bill of lading and packing slip).

#### Add Policy 4

Example of a business case.

- Customers allowing consolidation policy
  - Query: Specific Order pool to identify customers accepting consolidated shipments
  - Consolidation with open shipments is off
  - Consolidation is across orders with regular fields selected
  - Rule can be overridden on a sales order by selecting another order pool

To create a shipment consolidation policy that covers mentioned above business case, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Release to warehouse \> Shipment consolidation policies**.
1. Click **New**.
1. In the **Policy name** field, type **Order pool**.
1. In the **Policy description** field, type a value, for example **Consolidate across orders based on order pool**.
1. Click  **Save**.
1. In the list of **Remaining fields**, find and select the **Mode of delivery** records.
1. Click ![forward arrow](media/forward-button.png) button.
1. Click **Edit query**.
1. In the list, find and add the **Sales orders.Pool** record.
1. In the **Criteria** field, enter or select a value, for example, **ShipCons**.
1. Click **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> All order lines where sales orders belong to the same Order pool will be consolidated into one shipment across sales orders for the same account, warehouse, and mode of delivery. Order pool can be replaced with any other field setting a group of customers apart and defaulting to the sales order header. This can be used if the customer and not the warehouse (like in the legacy logic) is driving the need for consolidation.

#### Add Policy 5

Example of a business case.

- Warehouses allowing consolidation policy
  - Query: Specific Order pool to identify warehouses that can consolidate shipments
  - Consolidation with open shipments is off
  - Consolidation is across orders with regular fields selected (replication of the current “Warehouse” checkbox)

To create a shipment consolidation policy that covers mentioned above business case, if it wasn't created automatically as part of Scenario 1, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Release to warehouse \> Shipment consolidation policies**.
1. Click **New**.
1. In the **Policy name** field, type a value, for example **CrossOrder**.
1. In the **Policy description** field, type a value, for example **Cross-order consolidation for specific warehouses**.
1. Click **Save**
1. In the list, find and select the **Mode of delivery**.
1. Click ![forward arrow](media/forward-button.png) button.
1. Click **Edit query**.
1. In the list of **Remaining fields**, find and select the **Warehouse** record.
1. In the **Criteria field**, type **61, 63**.
1. Click **OK**.
    - It is manual replication of the legacy logic where the consolidation decision was driven by specific warehouses.
1. In the list, find and select the desired policies and by using **Move up/Move down** buttons arrange them in the order of applicability (pyramid-like approach) as follows:
    1. CustomerMode
    1. Item type
    1. CustomerOrderNo
    1. Order pool
    1. CrossOrder
    1. Default
