title: Flexible warehouse-level dimension reservation 
description: This topic describes an enhancement to the inventory reservation policy that allows businesses, who sell batch-tracked products and run their logistics as WMS-enabled operations, to reserve specific batches for their customers’ sales orders even though the reservation hierarchy associated with such products disallows this (by being of a type that is commonly referred to as “Batch-below[location]”.)
