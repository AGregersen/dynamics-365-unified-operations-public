# System-directed cluster picking

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Cluster picking is a piece picking process that enables you to pick items for multiple orders at the same time by clustering them together into pick clusters, and thereby visiting the pick location only once. Typically, this functionality is used with small order picking or less than case quantities.

With the setup of system-directed cluster picking, you can cluster pick work headers based off of a system-generated cluster. The system will cluster picking orders up to the number of positions specified on the cluster profile. This allows you to pick multiple orders at the same time without having to create a cluster manually.

System-directed cluster picking offers an alternative to manual cluster building by using a cluster profile to create a cluster. Several setup-related lines need to be defined on the cluster profile before use.

- **Number of positions** corresponds with the number of orders that will be put on a cluster and consequently to the number of totes.
- **Break cluster** determines when should the cluster be broken.
- **Generate cluster ID** controls whether the cluster ID will be generated by the system or entered by the user.
- **Sort verification type** determines whether position verification is needed.

A new mobile device menu item should be used for system-directed cluster picking. The cluster profile ID must be specified on the **Directed by** option. The assignment of work orders can be optimized further by specifying customized sorting criteria on the system directed query order, which can group orders based on company-specific criteria.

At the time of picking using a system-directed cluster, warehouse workers will be presented with a cluster where picking orders have been pre-assigned assigned to cluster positions. Workers can therefore start picking an item for multiple work orders by visiting the pick location only once. The picking process for system-directed cluster picking is the same as for the user-directed cluster picking.

## Set up system-directed cluster picking

### Cluster profiles

Navigate to Warehouse management -  Setup - Mobile device - Cluster profiles. Cluster profile controls how each cluster will be created by the system. If different clusters are needed, different Cluster profiles should be created, one for each mobile device menu item.

In the **Header** , specify the following:

- --Cluster profile ID – _2 Position_
- --Name – _2 Position       _
In the **General** fast tab, the following setup must be specified:
- --Generate cluster ID – _Yes_
  - Determines whether the Cluster ID should be created automatically by the system or whether the user should create it at picking start.
- --Activate positions – _Yes_
  - Determines whether the position names should be generated automatically based on the Position name setup. If this is not selected, the license plate ID for the position is used.
- --Number of positions – _2_
  - Determines maximum number of positions the cluster can have (number of boxes, totes, etc.)
- --Position name - _Numeric_
  - Alphabetical – positions will be named in alphabetical order
  - Numeric – positions will be named in continuous numbers
- --Break cluster at – _Put_
  - Determines when the cluster should be broken
    - Put
    - Work close
- --Sort verification type – _Position scan_
  - Determines whether the put to position step should be verified
    - None
    - License plate scan
    - Position scan

In **Cluster sorting** fast tab, sorting criteria can be determined by creating a new line:

- --Sequence number – determines the sequence the system will sort by. It is added automatically but can be changed.
- --Field name – _WMSLocationId_
  - Determines what field will this line use for sorting criteria
- --Sorting – _Ascending_
  - Determines whether sorting should be Ascending or Descending

## Mobile device menu item

Navigate to Warehouse management - Setup - Mobile device -  Mobile device menu items

Create new mobile device menu item for System directed cluster picking. This where the Cluster profile ID is tied to the Mobile device menu item.

In **Header** , specify the following:

- --Menu item name – _SD Cluster_
- --Title – _SD Cluster_
- --Mode – _Work_
- --Use existing work – _Yes_

In **General** fast tab, the following setting can be specified:

- --Directed by – _System directed cluster picking_
- --Generate license plate – _Yes_
- --Cluster profile ID – _2 Position_
  - Here a specific Cluster profile is tied to the mobile device menu item

In **Work classes** fast tab, set up the valid work class for this mobile device menu item:

- --Work class ID – _Sales_
- --Work order type – _Sales orders_

A **System directed work sequence query** must also be specified, click on the button in the ribbon and create a new query:

- --Sequence number – _1_
- --Description – _Work priority – Work ID_

Click Edit query, and add the following to the Sorting tab

- --Table – _Work_
- --Derived table – _Work_
- --Field – _Work priority_
- --Search direction – _Ascending_

- --Table – _Work_
- --Derived table – _Work_
- --Field – _Work ID_
- --Search direction – _Ascending_

The system will now sort Work IDs within the cluster first based on Work priority, then on Work ID.

### Mobile device menu

Navigate to Warehouse management - Setup - Mobile device - Mobile device menu and add the newly created menu item to the desired menu.

# Process – Demo 1

### Create picking work

Before system directed cluster picking, some outbound work must be created. Previously created Cluster profile specifies 2 cluster positions, hence create at least two different Work IDs.

Navigate to _Sales and Marketing_ - _Sales orders_ - _All sales orders_. Click New to create a new sales order. Pick any customer. In the _General_ section specify warehouse 62.

1. Sales order 1: Add a new line to the sales order, item A0001, quantity 1 pcs. Add a second line for item A0002, quantity 3 pcs.
2. Sales order 2: Add a new line to the sales order, item A0001, quantity 4 pcs. Add a second line for item A0002, quantity 2 pcs.

Reserve the inventory and Release it to warehouse. Two different Work IDs will be created, each with two pick lines.

### Mobile device flow execution

Open mobile device menu where the SD Cluster was added during the setup.

Select the SD cluster menu item and initiate the pick. This will create a Cluster with two previously created Work IDs attached to it. If you had created more Work IDs, only the first two will be added to the cluster. Note that the Work IDs have been added to the Cluster in Ascending order, based on the Query setup.

After selecting the menu, you will be presented with the first pick screen. The system will aggregate all matching pick lines from the two Work IDs and ask the user to visit the pick location only once to satisfy both orders with one pick. This is done in the same fashion as with User directed cluster picking.

Confirm the first pick and the system will ask the worker to enter the Position name to confirm the put to each correct position.

Repeat this process until all items have been picked and put to the correct position.

The last step on the mobile device is to Put the Cluster to the final location. As this is confirmed, the cluster will be closed and broken due to the &#39;Break cluster at&#39; setting on the Cluster profile. Work IDs will also be closed.

&#39;Cluster complete&#39; message will be shown on the mobile device.

- --If enough additional Work IDs were created beforehand, new Cluster will be created automatically.
- --If not,enough additional Work IDs were created, &#39;Not enough work can be found for cluster&#39; message will be shown on the mobile device.
