# Configure shipment consolidation policies

# Released in version 10.0.3

# About

Insert link here TODO

For this demo, standard Contoso data is used with some additions noted below.

Scenario 1: Configure default shipment consolidation policies
Scenario 2: Configure custom shipment consolidation policies
Scenario 3: Override consolidation policy in “Release to warehouse” form
Scenario 4: Release to warehouse from Load planning workbench
Scenario 5: Shipment consolidation workbench

# Scenario 1: Configure default shipment consolidation policies 

## Default policies setup – new environment:
1.	Go to Warehouse management > Setup > Release to warehouse > Shipment consolidation policies.
2.	Click Create default setup.
- A „Default“ policy will be created for Sales orders
- A “Default” policy will be created for Transfer orders

Both policies will have the same set of fields taken into consideration by legacy logic, including order number (consolidate lines into shipments based on order number, warehouse, mode of delivery, address, etc.)
