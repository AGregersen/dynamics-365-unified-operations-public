# About

With this functionality, you can perform rapid quality checks on the spot at the time of receiving to the inbound dock area. These spot checks are beneficial when packaging or any other easily recognizable part of the item is being inspected. It serves as a quick look to see if anything is standing out as faulty before stocking the inventory to its&#39; location.

This function offers an alternative to existing quality check process with more flexibility and faster processing.

At the time of receiving, the worker is required to perform a desired quality check and must decide whether to accept or reject each license plate scanned after they have been registered. Accepted license plates will be guided to the storage location as normal, while rejected license plates will be diverted to a quality check location for further inspection. Existing put away work will be cancelled and new &#39;Quality Check&#39; work order will be created and the user will automatically continue with the put step. This process can also be automated to divert all scanned license plates to the quality check location immediately.
