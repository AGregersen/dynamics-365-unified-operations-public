# Quality check

With this functionality, you can perform rapid quality checks on the spot at the time of receiving to the inbound dock area. These spot checks are beneficial when inspecting packaging or any other easily recognizable part of the item. It serves as a quick look to see if anything is standing out as faulty before stocking the inventory to its location.

This functionality offers an alternative to the existing quality check process, offering more flexibility and faster processing. <!-- can we link to documentation for that existing functionality? How can we tell this feature apart from that functionality? Should this feature be called "quality spot check" "flexible quality check" or "advanced quality check" or something like that? -->

When you use this feature, arrival and quality check proceeds as follows:

1. When a shipment arrives, the warehouse worker registers the arrival, and also registers its location by scanning a license plate.
1. The worker does a quick quality check and records the result (pass or fail) for that license plate.
1. One of the following happens:
    - License plates containing accepted items are guided to a storage location as usual.
    - For the rejected license plates, existing put-away work is cancelled and a new *quality check* work order is created. The license plate is then diverted to a quality check location for further inspection.

<!-- The above wasn't entirely clear in the draft. I tried to clarify with this revision. Please confirm it's still correct -->

This process can also be set to divert all scanned license plates to the quality check location immediately.

## Enable the quality check feature

Before you can use this feature, it must be enabled on your system. Administrators can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the feature status and enable it if needed. Here, the feature is listed as:

- **Module** - Warehouse management
- **Feature name** - Quality check

## Set up and try out this feature

This section provides an example of how to set up and use this feature.

### Enable sample data

To work through this example using the sample records and values specified here, you must be on a system with the standard [demo data](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/deployment/deploy-demo-environment.md) installed, and you must select the **USMF** legal entity before you begin.

You can also use this example as guidance for how to use this feature when working on a production system, but then you must substitute your own values for each setting described here.

### Set up a work template that includes quality control

<!-- KFM: Briefly describe what this is and why we are doing this. -->

1. Go to **Warehouse management > Setup > Work > Work templates**.
1. Set **Work order type** to "Purchase orders" to start working with templates of that type.
