# Report as finished to a license plate controlled location from the Job card device 

The process called Reporting as finished completes finished products on a production order to the inventory. If the finished product is enabled for the advanced warehouse processes, the product is reported as finished to a location called the production output location. For information about setting up the production output location, see [Production output location](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/production-control/production-output-location).

You must select an existing license plate number to complete this task. If the production output location is set up to be tracked by license plate, then a license plate number must be included when reporting the production output location as finished. The **License plate** field is visible on the **Report progress** prompt on the **Job card device** page. The field is only visible on the **Report progress** prompt when reporting on the last operation of the production order. The field is only shown if the item for the production order is enabled for the warehouse management processes.
