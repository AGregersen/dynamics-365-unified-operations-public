# Report as finished from the job card device

The process called *Reporting as finished* completes finished products on a production order to the inventory.

<!-- KFM: I think a longer intro is needed to orient the reader as to what we are doing here, and that the following text should actually be in a section, but I'm not sure what to call that section. -->

A worker uses the **Report progress** page on the job card device to report product quantities as finished when the worker has completed the last operation of a production or batch order. Workers can also use the **Report progress** page to report progress on operations that are not defined as the last operation in a production route. Quantities reported on those operations are not tracked in the inventory, but can be used to view progress and can be included in rules that control whether workers are permitted to start the next operation before reaching a defined threshold of reported quantities on the previous operation. You can define these rules on the **Quantity validation** tab of the **Production order defaults** page.

You can also control whether the quantities reported on the last operation should report as finished the finished product to the inventory. To set this option, go to the **Report as finished** tab of the **Production order defaults** page and set the **Update finished report on-line** drop-down list to **Status + Quantity** or **Quantity**.

For more information about how to work with the **Production order defaults** page, see [Production parameters in Manufacturing execution](production-parameters-manufacturing-execution.md).

## Report batch-controlled items as finished

The job card device supports three scenarios for reporting on batch items:

- **Manually assigned batch numbers**: The user is reporting a batch number that comes from an external source, which isn't known to the system prior to reporting.
- **Pre-defined batch numbers**: The batch numbers are automatically generated by the system before the production order is released to job card device.
- **Fixed batch numbers**: The batch number is assigned to the production order before it is released.

To enable each of these scenarios:

1. Go to **Product information management > Products > Released products**.
1. Select the product you want to configure.
1. Expand the **Manage inventory** FastTab.
1. Open the **Batch number group** drop-down list and select the tracking number group that is configured to support your your scenario.

See the following subsections for more information about how to set up tracking number groups to support each of the three scenarios mentioned for for reporting on batch items.

### Set up a tracking number group that allows workers to assign a batch number manually

The field **Manual** should be set to **Yes**

When the user is Reporting progress from the job card device, he can enter the batch number he wants report in the batch number field

### Set up a tracking number group that selects a pre-defined batch number

When the field **Only for inventory transactions** is selected one or more batch numbers will automatically be assigned to the production order when it is created. These number will be assigned to the inventory transactions of the production order. The field **Per qty.** is splitting the batch number per the specified quantity in this field. If for example a production order is created for 10 pieces, and **Per qty.** is specified 2, then 5 batch numbers will be assigned to the production order when it is created.

When the user is Reporting progress from the job card device, he can select between the pre-defined batch numbers from a list.

### Set up a tracking number group that reports on a fixed batch number

When the field **Only for inventory transactions** is set to **No** it is indicated that a batch number will be automatically assigned to the production order when it is created. In this scenario it is expected only to report on this fixed batch number.

When the user is Reporting progress from the job card device, the fixed batch number is shown in the batch number field. The field is not editable in this case.

Note: If a batch controlled item does not have tracking dimension group defined, the behavior when reporting as finished from the job card device, will be manual assignment of the batch number.

## Report as finished items that are enabled for advanced warehouse processes

For items that are enabled for the advanced warehouse processes, reporting as finished is always done to the **Production output location**. The production output location is defined on the resource for the last operation on the production route. (Read more about it here). The production output location can be defined to be tracked by its license plate. This is setup in the **Location profile ID** in the field **Use license plate tracking**. The **Location profile ID** is associated the location. If the production output location is setup to be tracked by license plate, then a license plate has to be specified when reporting as finished.

The job card device supports different scenarios for reporting as finished to a license plate-controlled output location.

1. The user is reporting to an existing license plate on the production output location. This scenario is for example relevant if the license plate is representing a pallet and the user on a continuous basis is reporting items to the same pallet as the finished goods are completed in the production process.
1. For each report as finished the user is reporting to a new license plate and printing out a license plate label for the new license plate number.

The configuration of the use of license plate is configured in the **Configure job card for devices** page.

Select **Generate license plate** if a new license plate number should be generated for each report as finished.

Select the **Print label** option if a label for the license plate should be printed for each report as finished. The label is configured in the **Document routing** menu.
