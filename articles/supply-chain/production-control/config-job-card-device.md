# Configure job card for devices

<!-- KFM: Add a short intro. What is a job card device, what does it do? What will we do in this topic? -->

## Manage and configure your devices

To configure your job card devices, go to **Production control > Setup > Manufacturing execution > Configure job card for devices**. The **Configure job card for devices** page opens, which shows a list of existing devices. From here, you can do the following:

- Select any device listed in the left column to view and edit the configuration settings for that device
- Select **New** on the Action Pane to add a new device to the list. Then enter a name in the **Configuration** field to identify the new device. The value you enter here must be unique among all devices, and you won't be able to edit it later.

See the following sections for details about each of the settings and FastTabs provided here.

## General settings

The **General** FastTab lets you configure each of the various options available for the job card device. The following settings are available here:
