# Responding to vendor questions on Request for quotations

When your agency has sent a request for quotation (RFQ), vendors might have questions pertaining to the solicitation. The vendors can ask questions and receive answers in **Vendor collaboration**. When vendor questions are allowed, **Questions and answers** is available on the **Request for quotation bid** page on **Vendor collaboration** and for your agency through the **Request for quotation** page, **Questions and answers**. Users can publish answers to vendor questions more than once. After a vendor is selected and the RFQ is awarded, or the cutoff date for questions is reached, vendors can no longer enter questions.
