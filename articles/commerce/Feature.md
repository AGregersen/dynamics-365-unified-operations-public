# Feature

Feature is used for marketing products or promotions using a combination of image and text. For example, on the product details page a retailer can add a Feature module that uses both image and text to highlight the capabilities of the product. 

Feature module is driven by CMS data which can authored in the tooling. It’s a standalone module and does not have dependency on page context on any other modules in the page. Technically this allows Feature to be placed on any page where a C1 wants to promote content.

## Usage examples in ecommerce:

* Feature is used on the product details page to showcase the product features
* Feature can be used on the home page to promote products
* Feature can be used on a category page to highlight the category of products

| Image Placement   | Right, Left, Top, Bottom                                     | Image placement defines the position of the image relative to the text. If Right is chosen, image will be on right of the text. Four different settings are available to configure. |
