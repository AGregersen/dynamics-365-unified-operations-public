# Save, preview and publish a page

This topic describes how to save, preview and publish a page on your website.

### Saving a page
In order to save a page you need to have it checked out to you and open in the page editor. Normally you would like to save a page after modifying it to ensure that in the case of any unexpected issue your changes are safely stored and not lost.

When you save a page, the changes will be visible only to you. Saving a page is primarily meant to be used for storing modifications when the page is not yet ready to be checked in. When you have finished with the page, it is recommended to check it in so that the changes become visible to others and it may be checked out by others should they have the need to modify anything on the page.

### Previewing a page
Page authoring tool offers two kinds of preview features. WYSIWYG preview is visible in the middle pane when you are in the page editor. WYSIWYG preview is automatically refreshed when you save the page and it can be manually refreshed by pressing the Refresh-button from the action ribbon. WYSIWYG preview renders the page as the end user will see it, but with authoring helpers rendered on top of the page. When you have finished with your modifications on the page you might want to preview the page exactly as the end user would see it. In that case you would click the "Preview"-button from the action ribbon and preview will open up in a separate window. The page in the preview-windows is rendered exactly as the end user would see it. You may resize the browser to confirm that responsive modules are rendering correctly in all viewpoints. One thing to keep in mind is that previewing unpublished content requires authentication and proper permissions. If you share the URL to the preview, anyone who opens it needs to have proper permissions in order to access the content.

### Publishing a page
When you have your page all ready to go, the next step is to publish it so that external users are able to see the content. Before publishing, the page needs to be checked in. You can publish and unpublish pages from either the page inspector or the page editor. Page inspector shows a list of pages and allows bulk operations. The page editor will always operate on the single page that is open in it.

If you want to publish your page(s) from the page inspector, you need to select your page(s), make sure they are checked in and then proceed to activate "Publish" from the action ribbon. This will publish the pages and you will see a notification in the authoring tool telling you that.

If you want to publish single page from page editor, the procedure is very similar. You need to have the page open in the page editor, ensure it has been checked in and then proceed to activate "Publish" from the action ribbon. This will publish the page and show you a notification telling you the same.

When you publish a page, it publishes just the page. In order to be able to navigate to your page and see it, you should also have URL pointing to it.

One important thing to keep in mind is that to be able to publish a page any images or fragments referenced by the page must also be published.
