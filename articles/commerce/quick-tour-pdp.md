# Quick tour of product details pages

This topic provides a quick tour of product details pages in Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

A product details page (PDP) provides detailed information about a product, and enables customers to select product options such as size, style, and color. A PDP should showcase all the product information a customer needs to make a purchase decision.

### Header and footer modules

The top of the page has a header which shows all the product categories and other pages that the retailer wants the customer to browse. On the bottom of the page is a footer with quick links to various topics that may interest customers.

### Buy box module

The main section of the PDP begins with a **buy box**, which is the most important module on a PDP. The buy box is a container module that hosts several modules which hold key information about the product such as product name, product images, description, price, and product ratings. It enables the user to select any product options (for example, size, style, and color) and add the product to the cart. A buy box module needs a product ID, which is derived from the page context. If this module is placed on a page where the page context does not have a product ID, it will not render the information correctly. 

A buy box module also enables the shopper to buy the product online and pick it up in a nearby store. The buy online and pick up in store module integrates with Bing Maps APIs to find stores nearby or in a customer-specified location.

### Product specifications module

The **product specifications** module can be used to showcase additional details about the product, and are pulled from product attributes in Dynamics 365 Retail. Any attribute that is set to "visible=true" will be shown on the product specifications module. This module requires a product ID to retrieve the product attributes.

### Recommendations module

The **Recommendations module** is a key module on the product details page. When browsing for products, customers should be presented with more product options so they can find the right product and make a purchase. Recommendations help customers easily discover more related content and continue their shopping journey. This can be achieved using different types of recommendation lists, as follows.

- **People also like** is a machine learning-based list that uses the transaction history of other customers to provide recommendations. This list is is generated by the recommendations service and is similar to "Customers who bought this also bought *(another product)*" lists. A product ID is needed to generate the list.
- **Related** is a list that can be configured for a product in Retail. For example, for a brown travel leather handbag, more handbags that are leather-based or are for travel purposes can be configured for the related list. Other types of related lists such as **Accessories** and **More like this** can also be configured in Retail. A product ID is needed to generate related lists, so if added to a home page where there is no product ID context, the list will be empty. 
- Algorithmically-generated recommendation lists such as **Trending**, **Best Selling** and **New** can be used on product details pages. These lists may not be directly related to the product but they are another way to help customers find products that may interest them. These types of lists don't require a product ID context, but are generic lists that are generated based on shopping patterns across the site.
- **Editorial** lists are manually-curated lists. For example, a retailer may decide to manually curate lists of products that they want to showcase.

### Ratings and reviews module

The **ratings and reviews** module displays ratings and reviews that have been provided by other shoppers. In addition, it enables the shopper to write a review for a product. It also displays a histogram that shows the ratings trend for a product. For more details see [Ratings and reviews overview](ratings-reviews-overview.md).

### Marketing modules

If marketing content is unique to a specific product, any marketing module can be added to a product details page. This can be achieved by enriching a product details page. For more information, see [Enriching a product page](enrich-product-page.md).
