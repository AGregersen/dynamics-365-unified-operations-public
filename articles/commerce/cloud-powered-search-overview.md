This topic gives an overview of cloud-powered search in Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

Product discoverability is the easiest and quickest way for customers to be able to find products by browsing categories, searching, and filtering. Retailers consider product discovery a primary tool for customer interaction across all retail channels.

Customers are used to the near-instantaneous response times of web search engines, sophisticated e-Commerce websites, social apps, as-you-type search suggestion, faceted navigation, and highlighting. If customers cannot find the right product fast enough, they will not hesitate to move over to an e-Commerce store that helps them quickly find what they are looking for.

The cloud-powered product discoverability in Commerce helps retailers continue to grow their share of consumer retention and conversion rates across all channels including both e-Commerce & point of sale. 

The Commerce search experience has improved capabilities to help retailers achieve better product discoverability, while delivering the scalability and performance required for e-Commerce traffic.

### Browse and search 

Search relevance and performance is key to the omnichannel experience, since product discovery relies primarily on search for information retrieval and content navigation. An effective and efficient browse and search experience helps increase conversion.

The following image shows an example of typical browse and search functionality.

### Faceted navigation and choice summary 

Faceted navigation helps customers browse for content more easily by filtering on refiners that are tied to terms in a term set. By using faceted navigation, you can configure different refiners for different terms in a term set without having to create additional pages. And after application of the customer's choice of refiners, a summary of the choices is displayed.

The following image shows an example of faceted navigation in search.

### Immersive autosuggest

Current autosuggest functionality only shows keywords that trigger search for the matching keyword. With new enhancements in Commerce, customers are often able to discover links to products before they finish typing. Commerce also supports "keyword match in various categories" functionality, which enables customers to see the count of matching keywords across categories and trigger a search for a keyword in other categories.

The following image shows an example of immersive autosuggest in action.

### Sort

With enhanced sorting in Commerce, customers are able to sort search, browse, and refine search results by criteria such as price, product name, and product number, and also by whether a product is new, top-selling, or recently added.
