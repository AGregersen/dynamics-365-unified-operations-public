# E-Commerce site overview

Retailers want to create a customized ecommerce solution that is responsive and showcases their products. It needs to be unique and relate to their customer base. Customers should be able to continue their shopping journey across devices (Desktop or Mobile) and channels (Online, Brick and Mortar or Call center) seamlessly.

The online store is a retailer’s opportunity to prove their brand value to their customers. Their brand value could be discounted prices, fast shipping, exceptional customer service or a collection of premium products. Its critical that the online store can be customized to match the retailer’s brand. 

The Dynamics 365 Commerce Core solution provides a full end to end solution for ecommerce. It supports a rich back office (HQ_ that allows to create products, manage inventory, orders, payment connectors etc. 

It supports an Authoring experience which allows the retailer to author pages and templates for the online store. It also supports a rich set of modules (UX components with functional behavior). A combination of modules authored on a page can deliver experiences. Using the authoring tool and the modules that are provided, the pages needed for an end-to-end ecommerce site can be built.

Ecommerce pages support the following:

**Ecommerce flow –** These are pages that enable the online transactions such as Search results, Product details page, Cart and Checkout pages. These pages interact with the back office via Retail server APIs to render product information and to complete the transaction.  

**Useful information –** These are pages such as Terms and conditions, Customer service, Shipping and Returns that must be provided to shoppers of the site. These pages can be built with starter kit modules.

**Ratings service –** User ratings for a product area is one of factors that drive a shopper to make a shopping decision. A Rating service is supported that allows shoppers to provide/view ratings and reviews for the products. Ratings for the products are displayed on Search results, Product details page and other lists. See more on Ratings service for details

**Recommendations service –** When a user comes to an ecommerce site, retailers want to provide them with ways to discover more products. Recommendations driven by purchase signals, trends etc are a strong way for retailers to urge shoppers to make a purchase decision. We support the following algorithmically and machine learned lists such as New, Trending, Best Selling, Frequently bought together and People Also Like.
