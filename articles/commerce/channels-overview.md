This topic presents an overview of setting up Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce channels.

## Overview
This topic provides an overview of the section on setting up the various Dynamic 365 Commerce channels. It includes information about the tasks that you must complete both before and after you set up each channel. 

## Channels
Dynamics 365 Commerce supports three different channel types: **Retail**, **Call Center** and **Online**.  Below you'll find details relating to each. 

### Retail channel
Retail channels represent standard brick-and-mortar stores. Each retail store can have its own point of sale (POS) registers, income accounts and expense accounts, and staff. 

### Call Center channel
Call center channels(TBD).

### Online channel
Online channels represent online e-Commerce storefronts. Once an online channel is created a site must be created using the [site builder](link tbd) tool.

## Channel set up basics
Channel set up is perfomed in the Commerce Headquarters tool. Each channel can have its own payment methods, price groups, product hierarchies, assortments and set of products. You must set up some of these elements before you create the channel but they can be modified afterwards as well. After you create the channel, you assign the products that you want it to carry. You also assign employees, registers, and customers to retail channels. Finally, you add the new channel to an organization hierarchy.

## Channel setup pre-requisites
Before you can set up a channel, you must complete some prerequisite tasks. You can then create the channel and add details.
