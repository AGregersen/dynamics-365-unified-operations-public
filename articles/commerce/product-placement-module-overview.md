# Product collection module 

Product collection represent physical products and services on the website. On interaction, the product collection typically navigates to a detail page for users to purchase, acquire, or learn more about the product or service. 

Retailers consider product discovery as a primary tool for customer interaction across their website. With this module, we aim to provide retailers a quick & intuitive visual interface for authoring the product collections & enable them to build compelling shopping experiences on their website.

Thumb-rule: Always use product placements to show a group of products of a similar type or theme. 

The source for the product groups or collection â€“ could be an editorial collections (manually defined in back-office as related products for a product, or product lists), smart-logic based grouped results like new, best-selling, trending etc & machine-learning based recommendations.
