This topic gives an overview of the compliance guidance provided to make your company's sites compliant using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. The compliance guidance will include a review of areas to consider when using Dynamics 365 Commerce to assist you in meeting your company's compliance requirements.

Compliance is an important factor for all businesses as it helps your user base to connect with your site content. Staying compliant can also protect a company from expensive legal actions or hefty fines.

Topics in this section will provide examples of how to use Dynamics 365 Commerce authoring tools with compliance in mind. It is up to you to review your company's compliance requirements and to author and build sites to meet those requirement standards.
