The **Product details** page is the page that provides detailed information about a product. It allows your customers to configure and choose the options (dimensions) of the product. It should have all the information about the product so the user can make a purchase decision.

The top of the page has a Header which shows all the product categories and other pages that retailer wants the shopper to browse. On the bottom of the page is a Footer with quick links to various topics that a shopper may be interested. Refer to the help topics for Header and Footer for more details.

The main section on the Product details page begins with a **Buy Box**. This is the most important module on the product details page. The buy box is technically a container module that hosts several modules which hold key information about the product such as the product name, product images, description, price and product ratings. It allows the user to configure the dimensions of the product (e.g. size, style, color etc.) and add it to cart. A buy box module needs context of a product id which is derived from the page context. If this module is placed on a page where the page context does not have product id, it will not render the information correctly. 

A buy box also allows the shopper to buy the product online and pick up in a nearby store. The buy online and pick up in store module integrates with Bing Maps APIs to find nearby stores and stores in a user specified location

Below the buy box, we can add various other modules on a product details page. Product Specifications module can be used to showcase additional details about the product which are modelled as product attributes in HQ. Any attribute that is set to visible=true will be shown on the product specifications module. This module also requires product ID to retrieve the product attributes.

The **Recommendations module** is a key module on the product details page. When a shopper is browsing for a product, we want them to easily discover more related content and continue their shopping journey. They should be presented with more product options so they can find the right product and make a purchase. This can be achieved via different types of recommendation lists.

- **People Also like** is a machine learning based list that uses transaction history of other customers to provide recommendations to the user. This list is similar to “Customers who bought this also bought”. It takes the product id as seed to generate the list. It only works when the product id (context) is available. This list is generated by Recommendations service <link>.
- **Related** is a list that can configured for a product in HQ. E.g. For a Brown travel leather handbag, more handbags that are leather based or for travel purposes can be configured in HQ. Other types of lists can also be configured in HQ, E.g. Accessories, More like this etc. This list also needs context of a product, it derives this context from the page. If this list is added to a home page where there is no context, it will be empty. Similar to Related, any list can be manually configured for a product in HQ
- Algorithmically generated recommendation lists such as **Trending**, **Best Selling** and **New** can be used on the product details page. These may not be directly related to the product but they are another way to help a shopper to find products that may interest them. These lists don’t require a seed or product context. They are generic lists generated based on shopper patterns across the site.
- Another way to generate is to manually curate them (editorial lists). A retailer may decide to manually curate lists that they want to showcase. These lists can be showcased on the product details page.

**Ratings and Reviews** is another key module on the product details page. This module showcases the ratings and reviews that have been provided by other shoppers. In addition, it allows the shopper to write a review for the product. It also has a Histogram module which shows the ratings trend for the product. For more details refer to Ratings and Review<link>.

Any **marketing module** can be added to a product details page. These modules will be driven via CMS data. If the marketing content is unique to a specific product this can be achieved by enriching a product details page. See the [Enriching a product details page]() help topic for more information.
