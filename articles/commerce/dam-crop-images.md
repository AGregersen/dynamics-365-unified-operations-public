This topic describes how to crop images in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder.

## Overview

The Commerce site builder Media Library allows you to crop images to optimize them for different module types and viewports.

## Crop an image

To crop an image in site builder, follow these steps.

1. In the left navigation pane of Commerce site builder, select **Media Library**.
1. In the main window, select the image you want to modify.
1. On the command bar, select **Edit** to check out the file.
1. Select the image to enter **Edit Mode**.
1. Under **Edit Mode**, select **Edit View by Module**.
1. Select the module type from the **Module** drop down menu.
1. Select the view type from the **View type** drop down menu.
1. Select the image placement from the **Placement** drop down menu.
1. Select the viewport size from the **Viewport** drop down menu.
1. The image is overlaid with the area representing the crop region. Move and resize the crop region as needed. The aspect ratio will be maintained automatically.
1. When done, on the command bar select **Save**, and then select **Finish editing**. 

After custom cropping is completed, image modifications will take effect almost immediately.
