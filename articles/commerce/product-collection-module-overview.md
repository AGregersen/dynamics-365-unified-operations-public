This topic provides an overview of product collection modules in Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

Product discovery is a primary tool for retailers to engage with their shoppers across their website. With this module, we aim to provide retailers a quick & intuitive visual interface for authoring the product collections & enable them to build compelling shopping experiences on their website.

Product collection modules represent physical products and services on the website. On interaction, the product collection typically navigates to a detail page for users to purchase, acquire, or learn more about the product or service. 

The source for the product groups or collection â€“ could be an editorial collections (manually defined in back-office as related products for a product, or product lists), algorithmic lists like new, best-selling, trending or machine-learning based recommendations.

> [!NOTE]
> Always use product collection modules to show a group of products of a similar type or theme other than the search results. And for default categorized products & search results use 'Category page summary > Category page > Product Slot > Product search result'.

The following table shows product collection modules and their types and descriptions.
