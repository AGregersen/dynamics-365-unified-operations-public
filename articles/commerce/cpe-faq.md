# Commerce preview environment FAQ

This topic provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce preview environment.

### Hi, I have received an invitation to D365 Commerce preview on my account but I want to set up the Commerce environment in another tenant (due to the fact that I'm not global admin in my company tennant). Is it possible to transfer the invitation on the other tenant instead?  
 For invitation transfers, you can use this form to provide us with the details: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR5U60_Q9JVZPrDeJLlFt9MBUOEMxWjNBTU5aRVZJWEIzQUZDNVZPQ1dWNi4u
 
###  How long will the transfer take approximately? 
 3-5 business days
 
###  will it not work with an F&O project? 
 Correct, it only works with the retail projects.
 
###  By when is this going to be available on F&O environment?
 Undisclosed at the moment

###  What to do if our customer is an F&O customer that also is implementing retail and needs an e-commerce storefront? 
 This is the evaluation environment process. If you need an environment for an implementing customer, please reach out to us.
 
###  What do you consider as 'Commerce Preview'? Provisioning a pure 'retail' preview environment for a prospective customer? Or provisioning the 'e-commerce' features that are in 'preview' on top of an existing application/environment implementing retail as well?
 At this point, the "Commerce Preview" is available only on new environments deployed on Retail SKU projects with demo data from 10.0.6.
 
###  When we deploy it on Azure via LCS, what costs are involved? Only the CPU computing hours of the machine or also additional costs for e.g. Azure websites? 
 HQ is the only component hosted in your subscription. The other components will be hosted in Microsoft subscriptions.
 
###  Is there a calculation option to estimate the monthly costs?
 TBD
 
###  what regions are supported currently? 
 Evaluation is supported only in North America Geo
 
###  why no VHD with complete onebox? Setting this thing up is quite a pain... 
 RCSU, e-Commerce are complete SaaS, must be cloud hosted
 
###  is there a time limit on running the preview environment?
 30 days
 
###  What is the reasoning that D365 Commerce is only available for 30 days? Can we make multiple request for a preview? 
 If 30 days is not enough for evaluation, you should reach out to us. What would be the reason for multiple requests for a preview? We grant quota of single preview environment per accepted request. Should you need more than that, please reach out to us.
