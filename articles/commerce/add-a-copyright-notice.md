This article explains the steps required in order to add a copyright notice to your e-Commerce website.

## Prerequisites
Before you can add a copyright notice on your site, you must:

- Have a template that includes the footer fragment you'll be editing in the instructions below.
- Have a page that uses that template.

To add a copyright notice to the footer for your site, follow these steps:

1. Open the footer fragment by going to the **Fragments** tab and selecting Footer
1. Click **Check out** to make the Footer fragment writeable 
1. Expand the footer module and sub footer Slot
1. Select **Sub footer** or if it does not exist, click the ellipsis menu in order to add it using "Add module"
1. Click **Add Data Source** from the properties pane, Choose **Heading**
1. Add your copyright notice in **Input text** field.

After saving the fragment your copyright notice is visible automatically on all pages that use the Footer.
