# Content Placement 

Content placement is a special container that allows modules to be placed within it in a specific layout. Content placement module supports Content placement item, Account welcome item, Account order item, Account Wishlist item and Account profile item. Its usage varies based on which modules are added to it. 

Content placement is a container of other modules and derives data from the children modules that it supports. 

## Usage examples in ecommerce:

* When content placement items are added to a content placement module, its used for showcasing product features, promotions and other informational messages using both image and text. See content placement items for more details.  

* When account welcome item or account order item are added to a content placement itâ€™s used in Account management page. See Account management for more details.
