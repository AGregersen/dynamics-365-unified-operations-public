This topic presents an overview of the Dynamics 365 Commerce starter kit.

## Overview

The Dynamics 365 Commerce starter kit is a collection of modules that can be used to build an e-Commerce website. Modules have both user interface and functional behavior aspects. A theme (using CSS) can be applied to these modules to change their look and feel. A theme for a fictitious e-Commerce site named "Fabrikam" is provided as part of the starter kit to use as a reference. 

## Starter kit modules

The following types of modules are provided in the starter kit.

**Container module**: A container module is a simple modules that acts as a host for other modules. It controls the layout of the modules within it.

**Marketing modules**: Marketing modules include Hero, Feature, Content Placement, Content Rich Nlock, Video Player, and Carousel modules, all of which can be used to showcase content. These modules can be placed on any page and are driven by CMS data.

**Header and footer modules**: Header and footer modules appear in the header and footer of all site pages. These properties of these modules can be used to configure them as needed.

**Search modules**: Products can be discovered using the search module in the header, and search results appear on the search results page. Products can also be discovered on category pages, which are dedicated pages for each category supported in the channel navigation hierarchy. In addition, refiners modules can be used to further filter results on search and category pages.

**Product details page modules:** Product details pages use a number of modules to display product information. The buy box module enables the customer to a view product and add it to the cart. Other modules such as the tech specs module display the product details. The ratings and reviews module can used to view and provide reviews.

**Buy online pick up in store module:** The buy online pick up in store module integrates with Bing Maps to find stores nearby where the shopper can pick up a purchased product.

The checkout module captures shipping address, delivery options, gift card, loyalty program, and credit card information for processing an order. Once an order is placed, order confirmation module can be used to show the confirmation details.

**Account management modules**: Sign-in and sign-up modules enable a customer to create an account or sign in to an existing account. Once an account is created, the order history and order details modules can be used to view recent order and order details respectively.
