# Ratings and reviews

Ratings and reviews are crucial for consumers to understand how a product is perceived by fellow consumers and they help consumers make a purchase decision. Ratings and reviews in Dynamics 365 Commerce allow retailers to capture reviews along with a rating for a product from consumers and show the average ratings and reviews information across an e-Commerce website. 

Average ratings information is displayed in point of sale (POS) and call center channels so that sales associates can help end users make decisions. Retailers also can use ratings and reviews as a feedback mechanism to improve the quality of a product and thus improve sales.

In Commerce, the ratings and reviews solution is an omni-channel solution, and is available natively as part of the e-Commerce platform. The ratings and reviews solution is built on top of Azure, which provides high scalability and reliability.

Ratings and reviews uses Azure Cognitive Services to offer auto-moderation of profane words in 40 languages, which elimiates waiting for human approval and reduces moderation cost. The system also offers moderator tools to respond to end users concerns, feedback, or take downs, and to address any data requests from end users.  

Ratings and Reviews provides widgets that show ratings summaries in product lists, search results, product details page, and more. The widgets show complete reviews lists and provide sort and filters options for an e-Commerce website hosted on Dynamics 365 Commerce.

The feature provides a BI template with a set of metrics to give insights around ratings and reviews. Full data can be exported for further analysis.
