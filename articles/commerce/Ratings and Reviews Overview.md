# Ratings and reviews

Ratings and reviews are crucial for consumers to understand how a product is perceived by fellow consumers and they help consumers make a purchase decision. Ratings and reviews in Dynamics 365 Commerce allow retailers to capture reviews along with a rating for a product from consumers and show the average ratings and reviews information across an e-Commerce website. 

Average ratings information is displayed in point of sale (POS) and call center channels so that sales associates can help end users make decisions. Retailers also can use ratings and reviews as a feedback mechanism to improve the quality of a product and thus improve sales.

## Architecture

In Commerce, the ratings and reviews solution is an omni-channel solution, and is available natively as part of the e-Commerce platform. The ratings and reviews solution is built on top of Azure, which provides high scalability and reliability. 

Consumers who purchase products online can directly consume ratings and reviews to evaluate a product and provide a review after purchasing a product. Sales associates in physical stores or in a call center can use the ratings and reviews to help customers, as the information is also available in those channels.
