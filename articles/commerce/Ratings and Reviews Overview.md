# Ratings and reviews

Ratings and reviews are crucial for consumers who want to understand how other consumers perceive a product. They also help consumers make purchase decisions. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Commerce, the ratings and reviews solution lets retailers capture product reviews and ratings from consumers. They can then show the average ratings and review information across an e-Commerce website.

Average rating information is shown in point of sale (POS) and call center channels, so that sales associates can help users make decisions. Retailers can also use ratings and reviews as a feedback mechanism to improve the quality of a product and therefore improve sales.

In Dynamics 365 for Commerce, the ratings and reviews solution is an omni-channel solution and is natively available as part of the e-Commerce platform. The ratings and reviews solution is built on top of Microsoft Azure. Azure provides high scalability and high reliability.

The ratings and reviews solution uses Azure Cognitive Services to offer automatic moderation of profane words in 40 languages. Therefore, there is no need to wait for human approval, and moderation costs are reduced. The system also offers moderator tools that can be used to respond to user concerns, feedback, or take-downs, and to address any data requests from users.

The ratings and reviews solution provides widgets that show rating summaries in product lists, in search results, on product details page, and in other places. The widgets show complete review lists, and they also provide sort and filter options for an e-Commerce website that is hosted on Dynamics 365 for Commerce.

The solution also provides a business intelligence (BI) template that includes a set of metrics to provide insights into ratings and reviews. Full data can be exported for further analysis.
