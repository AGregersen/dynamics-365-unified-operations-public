# Task management in POS

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes task management in Dynamics 365 Commerce's point of sale (POS) application.

## Overview

Dynamics 365 Commerce's POS application has task management features that enable store managers and workers to manage tasks and update task status. Store workers can access tasks from the task tile on the POS home screen or by selecting task notifications. By default, store workers will land on the **My tasks** tab to view tasks assiogned to them and can easily switch to view **All tasks**, **Past due tasks**, and **Task lists**. 

## Tasks operations for store managers

Store managers can perform the following task operations in the POS application using command bar actions:

- **Assign Tasks**: Assign selected task(s) to a store worker.
- **Tasks status**: Change the status of selected task(s).
- **Filter**: By default, only active tasks are displayed. By using the filter option, managers can view all tasks, including completed or canceled tasks. 
- **New task**: Create a task under an existing task list, or create an ad hoc task.

Store workers can perform the following task operations in the POS application using command bar actions:

- **Tasks status**: Change the status of selected task(s).
