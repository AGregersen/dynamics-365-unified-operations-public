# Create a new Dynamics 365 e-Commerce site

This topic introduces the concept of an online store and how they're used in Dynamics 365 Commerce. It also provides a link to more information about online stores and how to set one up.

Before you can build your site in Dynamics 365 Commerce, you must have at least one online store set up in Dynamics 365. An online store in Dynamics 365 is where you establish the products, pricing, languages, payment methods, delivery modes, fulfillment centers and other aspects of the online experience you enable for your customers. 

To get started with Dynamics 365 Commerce, you only need one online store set up. However, a single Dynamics 365 Commerce site can serve the online experience for multiple online stores. For example, if you have multiple online stores set up to support different geographical regions, it is possible to serve the unique experiences defined by each of those stores with a single set of pages. To learn more about how to configure a site to support multiple online stores, see [Associate a site with a Dynamics eCommerce Channel](http://). 

Once you have an online store set up, it is now available to be associated with the Dynamics 365 Commerce site that will serve as your online storefront. To learn about online stores and how to set one up, see the [Set up online stores](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/online-stores) topic. 

For guidance on associating your online store with your site, see the [Associate a site with a Dynamics e-Commerce online store](http://) topic.
