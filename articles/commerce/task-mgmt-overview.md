# Task management overview

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of task management for managers and workers in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

Ensuring that tasks are performed by the right person at the right time in a retail environment is always difficult. Retailers want the ability to notify workers of upcoming tasks along with the related business context so that workers can complete the tasks correctly and on time.  

Task management in Dynamics 365 Commerce is a productivity feature that enables managers and workers to create tasks lists, manage assignment criteria, and track status and to integrate these tasks between back office and point of sale (POS) applications. 

Commerce task management enables headquarters persona to create tasks lists for retail stores and track status by store or by worker, and also create recurrent tasks (for example, "Thursday night closing checklist"). 

The task management feature also empowers store managers to assign tasks to individual workers, send notifications on upcoming or past due tasks, update task status, and create ad-hoc tasks within the POS application. Workers will see notifications, view task details, and update task status at POS.

The following diagram shows the conceptual architecture of task management in Dynamics 365 Commerce.

  ## Tasks list and tasks

A tasks list is a collection of tasks that must be completed as part of a business process. For example, there might be a task list that a new worker must complete while onboarding, a task list for an evening shift cashier to complete, and a task list to prepare the store for an upcoming holiday season etc. In Dynamics 365 Commerce a task list can be assigned to number of store and/or number of employees with a target date, and even recurrently. 

A task defines a specific piece of work or an action that someone must complete on or before the specified due date. In Dynamics 365 Commerce, a task will have ability to provide detailed instructions, contact person, and ability to link a task with Backoffice operation, POS operation, or a URL so that Task owner can jump start with context and improve the productivity.
