# Task management overview

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of task management for managers and workers in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

Ensuring that tasks are performed by the right person at the right time in a retail environment is always difficult. Retailers need the ability to notify workers of upcoming tasks with related business context so that tasks can be completed correctly and on time.  

Task management in Dynamics 365 Commerce is a productivity feature that enables managers and workers to create tasks lists, manage assignment criteria, and track task status while integrating these operations between Commerce back office and point of sale (POS) applications. 

Commerce task management enables headquarters persona to create tasks lists for retail stores and track status by store or by worker, and also create recurrent tasks (for example, "Thursday night closing checklist"). 

The task management feature also empowers store managers to assign tasks to individual workers, send notifications on upcoming or past due tasks, update task status, and create ad-hoc tasks within the POS application. Workers will see notifications, view task details, and update task status at POS.

The following diagram shows the conceptual architecture of task management in Dynamics 365 Commerce.
