This topic shows you how to set or change your site's theme.

## Overview

Your site's layout and style (fonts, sizes, colors, etc.) are defined by the theme you select and apply to the site. A theme is created and deployed by a developer at your company. For an overview of themes, see [Theming overview](http://). See [Create a new theme](http://) for more information on building and deploying themes.

When you create a new site, it is configured with a theme called Fabrikam which is provided as part of the starter kit. After you have deployed additional themes for your site, you can configure the site to use one of those themes. 

## Change the site theme

To change the theme that is applied to your site, do the following.

1. Navigate to your site in the site authoring environment
1. Go to **Site Management** and open **Extensions**.
1. Scroll down to the **Site Theme** section and expand it.
1. Choose a theme from the dropdown menu.

[!NOTE]
The theme you select will be applied to your published site as soon as you click **Save and publish** on the Extensions page. If you wish to preview a theme on your site, you can use your development or sandbox environment.
