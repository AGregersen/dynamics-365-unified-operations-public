This topic gives an overview of the Microsoft Dynamics 36 Commerce preview environment.

## Overview

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce preview environment is an optional end-to-end preview environment of Dynamics 365 Commerce that allows potential customers to try out the Commerce product before its general release to the public. 

The Commerce preview environment provides the complete Commerce experience with some minor restrictions that don't impact features or functionality, and can be used by customers and implementation partners to evaluate the product, provide feedback, and do fit/gap analysis.

## Commerce preview environment limitations

Although the Commerce preview environment provides the full features and functionality of Dynamics 365 Commerce, there are some minor limitations as follows:

- The Commerce preview environment is only available for use in the United States.
- Use of the Commerce preview environment is time-limited to 30 days from acceptance into the Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview program.
- The Commerce preview environment can only be successfully deployed and initialized on an environment that uses the demo topology, where all components of an environment are deployed in a single virtual machine (VM). The main limitation of this "one box" topology is the number of current users that the preview environment can support.
- The Commerce preview environment can only be used until the general availability (GA) of the Dynamics 365 Commerce product. New demo environments will be available after GA.

## Get started
