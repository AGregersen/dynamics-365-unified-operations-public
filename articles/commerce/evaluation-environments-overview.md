This topic gives an overview of the Commerce preview environment for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce preview environment is an optional end-to-end preview environment of Dynamics 365 Commerce that gives (potential) customers a sneak peek of the product. 

The Commerce preview environment provides the complete Commerce experience with some minor restrictions that don't impact features or functionality, and can be used by customers and implementation partners to evaluate the product, provide feedback, and do fit/gap analysis.

## Commerce preview environment limitations

Although the Commerce preview environment provides the features and functionality of the full Commerce product, there are some minor limitations:

- The Commerce preview environment is only available for use in the United States.
- Use of the Commerce preview environment is time-limited to 30 days from acceptance into the Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview program.
- The Commerce preview environment can only be successfully deployed and initialized on an environment that uses the demo topology, where all components of an environment are deployed in a single virtual machine (VM). The main limitation of this is the number of current users that the preview environment can support.
- The Commerce preview environment can only be used until the general availability (GA) of the Dynamics 365 Commerce product. New demo environments will be available after GA.

## Get started

To get started using the Commerce preview environment, see [Provision a Commerce preview environment](provisioning-guide.md).
