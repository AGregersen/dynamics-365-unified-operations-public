# Configure a domain name

This article describes how to configure a domain name for your Dynamics 365 e-Commerce site. 

### Adding domains when initializing e-Commerce

In order to associate domains with your e-Commerce environment, you should initialize e-Commerce as described in (link here). When you have activated the "Initialize e-Commerce" button, you are asked additional information that will be used for provisioning your e-Commerce environment. You should add all the domains you plan to use with this environment in the "Supported Host Names" field as instructed. This way they are configured in all the required e-Commerce components and are ready to be taken into use when you switch traffic from your CDN or webserver to point to the e-Commerce frontends.

### Adding domains after e-Commerce has been initialized

If you need to associate new domains with your e-Commerce environment after initialization, you need to do that through a service request.
