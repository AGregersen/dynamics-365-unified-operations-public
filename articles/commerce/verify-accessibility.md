**Verify Accessibility**

This topic describes how to verify page content accessibility in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

**Overview**

When you have finished modifying a page, you will want to ensure that the content is accessible for everyone on the web. You can easily do this in the Site Builder by using the integrated [Microsoft Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/en/) service. This will verify your page contents against the latest [W3C accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility) guidelines.

The [Microsoft Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/en/) integration must be enabled at the tenant or site level before you can use it.
