# Modify an existing page

This topic describes what actions user needs to take in order to modify an existing page.

When you need to modify your page, you will first want to open it in the page editor.

Navigate to the site which contains your page, then from the list of pages locate the page you want to change. If you are unable to locate the page easily, you can use the rich search functionality of the authoring tool. By typing the exact page name or first few letters followed with an asterisk, you will get a filtered list of pages that allows you to locate your page with ease. Proceed to click the page name in order to open it in the page editor.

Hint: When you have your page visible in the page inspector, you may proceed to select it and check it out before opening it in the page editor. This allows you to check out multiple pages at the same time should you have the need to do that.

When you have the page open in the page editor, you need to make sure it is checked out to you. Action ribbon in the authoring tool is dynamic and context- and state-sensitive, which means that it only shows you the actions you can perform on the page. If the page is not checked out, you will not see "Save" or "Check in" in the action ribbon. The state of the page is also visible on the right hand side of the screen. If the page is not checked out to you, proceed to click "Check out" from the action ribbon. Action ribbon will change to reflect the new state of the page and you will also get a notification indicating that the page was checked out to you.

Next step is to perform the actual changes. Typically you would use the "Page Outline"-view to navigate to the module that you want to modify, select it and perform modifications in the properties pane, which is the pane on the right side of the browser. Your modification could also be adding a module, removing a module or adding or removing a fragment. In order to add a fragment or module, you would use the "Page Outline"-view to locate the slot you want to add your module or fragment on and activate the ellipsis menu right side to its name. That would show you the menu with options to add a module or fragment. If you want to remove module or fragment, you will again use the "Page Outline"-view to locate the module or fragment in question and proceed to activate the ellipsis menu right to its name. This will give you the option to delete the module or fragment.

After performing your modifications and previewing them, you should check in your changes by activating "Check in" from the action ribbon, describing your modifications in the comment field and proceed with "OK". You will again see that the action ribbon will change to reflect the new state of the page and you will also see notification telling you the same.

Should you want to publish your modifications right away, you would activate the "Publish" button from the action ribbon and the latest checked in version of the page with your modifications would be published and available to external users viewing your site.
