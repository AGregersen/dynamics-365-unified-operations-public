# Preview environment provisioning guide
This guide provides you step-by-step instructions on how to provision and configure the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview environment.
## Summary
In order to provision the Preview environment successfully, the project needs to be created with a specific product name and type. Environment and Retail Cloud Scale Unit also have some specific parameters you need to use when provisioning them, in order to be able to start the e-Commerce provisioning later. These instructions contain all the required steps you need to take and parameters you need to use.

After successful provisioning, there are few post-provisioning steps you need to take in order to prepare your Preview environment for use. There are few steps which are optional, depending on which aspects of the system are you expecting to evaluate. Should you later change your mind, you can always run the optional steps later.
## Prerequisites
In order to complete the provisioning successfully, the following prerequisites must be met
* You have LCS access
* You have been accepted to the Commerce public preview program
* You have the required permissions to create either **Prospective presales**- or **Migrate, create solutions, and learn**-project
* You have **Environment manager** or **Project Owner** role in the project where you will be provisioning the environment
* You either need to have admin access to your Azure subscription or request Subscription admin to help you with the two steps that require admin permissions
* You have your AAD tenant Id available
* You have created AAD security group to be used as e-Commerce system admins group and you have its ID available
* You have created AAD security group to be used as Ratings and Reviews moderator group and you have its ID available (can be the same SG as the system admin group above)
## Provisioning preview environment
These instructions cover the provisioning of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview environment. After successfully completing these steps, you will have a Preview environment ready to be configured. All the activities described here take place in the LCS portal.
### Before starting
##### Grant access to e-Commerce applications
For this step you will need to know your AAD tenant Id. You need to authorize e-Commerce applications to access your Azure subscription. Easiest way to achieve this is to craft an URL like this:

https://login.windows.net/{AAD_TENANT_ID}/oauth2/authorize?client_id=fbcbf727-cd18-4422-a723-f8274075331a&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://sb.manage.commerce.dynamics.com/_commerce/Consent&response_mode=query&prompt=admin_consent&state=12345

Do not click the URL directly, instead copy and paste it to your browser or text editor and replace \{AAD_TENANT_ID\} with your AAD tenant Id, before navigating to the URL with browser. You will be presented with Microsoft AAD login dialog and confirmed if you wish to grant "e-Commerce UX" access to your subscription. You will be sent to a page which confirms if the operation was successful or not.

Note: The person logging in needs to be AAD tenant administrator. Without successfully completing this step, rest of the provisioning steps will fail.

Log in to the LCS portal at https://lcs.dynamics.com

Make sure that you are logged in with the LCS account that was used to request the preview access.
