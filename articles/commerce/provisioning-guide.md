# Commerce Preview environment provisioning guide
This guide provides you step-by-step instructions for provisioning and configuring your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview environment. Before you begin, it is recommended that you at least skim through the documentation to get an idea of what the process entails and what the guide contains.
## Summary
To provision the environment successfully, the project needs to be created with a specific product name and type. The environment and Retail Cloud Scale Unit also have some specific parameters you need to use when provisioning them to be able to start the e-Commerce provisioning later. These instructions contain all the required steps you need to take and parameters you need to use.

After successful provisioning, there are a few post-provisioning steps you need to take to prepare your Preview environment for use. Some steps are optional, depending on which aspects of the system you wish to evaluate. Should you later change your mind, you can always run the optional steps later.

If you have any questions about the provisioning steps or you encounter any issues, please let us know on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview Yammer group at https://aka.ms/Dynamics365CommercePreviewYammer

## Prerequisites
The following are prerequisites for provisioning your Dynamics 365 Preview environment:
* You have access to **LCS** (Lifecycle Services portal)
* You have been **accepted into the Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview program**
* You have the required permissions to create either **Prospective presales**- or **Migrate, create solutions, and learn**-project
* You are a member of the **Environment manager** or **Project Owner** role in the project where you will be provisioning the environment
* You have admin access to your Azure subscription, or contact with a subscription admin who can perform the two steps that require admin permissions on your behalf
* You have your **AAD Tenant Id** available
* You have created a **AAD security group** to be used as **e-Commerce system admins group** and you have its ID available
* You have created a **AAD security group** to be used as **Ratings and Reviews moderator group** and you have its ID available (can be the same SG as the system admin group above)
## Provisioning preview environment
These instructions cover the provisioning of a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Preview environment. After successfully completing these steps, you will have a Preview environment that is ready to be configured. All the activities described here take place in the LCS portal.
### Before starting
##### Grant access to e-Commerce applications
1. For this step you will need to know your **AAD Tenant Id**. You need to authorize e-Commerce applications to access your Azure subscription. The easiest way to accomplish this is to assemble a URL like this:

https://login.windows.net/{AAD_TENANT_ID}/oauth2/authorize?client_id=fbcbf727-cd18-4422-a723-f8274075331a&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://sb.manage.commerce.dynamics.com/_commerce/Consent&response_mode=query&prompt=admin_consent&state=12345

2. **Do not click the URL directly**, instead copy and paste it into your browser or text editor and replace **\{AAD_TENANT_ID\}** with your **AAD Tenant Id**, before navigating to the URL
3. You will be presented with the Microsoft AAD login dialog where you will confirm that you wish to grant **"e-Commerce UX"** access to your subscription
4. You will be sent to a page which confirms whether the operation was successful

*Note: **The person logging in needs to be AAD tenant administrator**. Without successfully completing this step, the rest of the provisioning steps will fail.*
