# Inventory settings on ecommerce


[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic covers Inventory settings and describes how these settings can be applied across ecommerce

## Overview
This setting is defined under Sites Settings\Extensions ina group called "Inventory". These settings enable Inventory checks on e-commerce. The inventory checks  provide the capability for a retailer to showcase inventory driven merchandising such as "In Stock" "Only few left" etc. When a product is out of stock these settings ensure the product cannot be purchased.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce provides on-hand availability for products which is used on e-commerce to drive the inventory scenarios. For details on how estimated on-hand availability is calculated for products see this  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/calculated-inventory-retail-channels.
