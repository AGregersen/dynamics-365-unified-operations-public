# Add a welcome message
This article explains how to add a welcome message to your e-Commerce website.

A welcome message can be used to inform visitors of your site about ongoing sale, updated site or seasonal collection availability.  You can set a message using the "Alert" module.

Alert module is best to be placed in the "Error/Information messages" slot of "Header" module. It allows you to specify the text to be shown as well as color, text alignment and whether the message can be dismissed.

When you set the message in your shared header fragment, the message will be shown on each page that is using the template where that shared fragment is used.
