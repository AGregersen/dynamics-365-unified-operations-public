# Store selector module


[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This topic covers Store selector module and describes how to add it to site pages in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

A Store selector module is used for buy online pick up in store scenario. It shows the list of stores where a product is available for pick-up. Store name, hours including inventory for each store is shown on the store selector module.
The module requires context of a product and a search location to find stores. In the absence of a search location, it defaults to the user's browser location, provided the user gives consent. The module has an input box which allows the user to enter a location (zipcode, city, state etc) to find stores that are nearby. 
The store selector module is integrated with the Bing Maps Geocoding application programming interface (API) to convert the location to a latitude and longitude. A Bing Maps API key is required and must be added to the Retail shared parameters page in Dynamics 365 Commerce. 
In addition, for buy online pick-up in store to work the products should be configured with the "Customer pickup" delivery mode. See for more details on how to configure this delivery mode. If a product is excluded for this delivery mode, the module will not be shown on the respective pages.
