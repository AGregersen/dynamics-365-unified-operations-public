# Quick tour of Home page

The **Home page** is the default page a shopper lands on when visiting an ecommerce site. This page typically showcases the products and promotions using a combination of marketing modules. It needs to be rich with images and text to keep the shopper engaged. Products need to be listed on the home page so the shopper can quickly discover products without a lot of effort and continue their shopping journey.  Below is an example of a Home page built with web starter kit and Fabrikam theme.

The top of the page has a Header which shows all the product categories and other pages that retailer wants the shopper to browse. On the bottom of the page is a Footer with quick links to various topics that a shopper may be interested. Refer to the help topics for Header and Footer for more details.

The main section of a Home page highlights products, category or products and promotions. This can be done using various modules.

**Hero**: The top of the Home page typically shows one or more Hero images which highlight new products and promotions in the store. If there are multiple Hero modules, they are hosted within a Carousel for the user to browse. Refer to the Hero module help topic for more details.

**Feature**: A feature can also be used within a Carousel or independently to showcase products and promotions. Refer to the Feature help topic for more details.

**Content Placement:** The Content Placement module is used to showcase multiple products or category of products using a mix of images text in a multi-column view. Refer to Content Placement for more details.

**Video Player:** A video player can be used to showcase video content on the home page. Refer to Video Player for more details.

**Content Rich block**: Content rick block can be used in a single or multi-column view for text content on the home page. Refer to Content Rick block for more details.

**Recommendations:** Product recommendations lists such as New, Trending, Best Selling etc. can be displayed on the Home page. These lists showcase products based on shopping trends. Lists can be algorithmically generated or curated manually. They help the shopper quickly discover top products and continue their shopping journey.

NOTE: These modules can be used on any page but their placement on the Home Page is important because your customersâ€™ first interaction with your site happens on your Home page.
