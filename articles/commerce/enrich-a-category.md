# Enrich a category landing page

This topic describes what enriching a category means and how you can do that from the authoring tool.
Your site has a default category page which is used when rendering category data, unless you have a different category page defined for a specific category. It contains required things like refiners, categorized product placement, sorting options, choice summary and pagination controls.

In many cases you will want to have more and specific content for your categories landing page. When you navigate to "Retail" in the authoring tool, you will see a list of categories from the channel assigned to the site. You will notice a column called "Enriched", when ticked, indicates that the category page has been enriched. Unticked "Enriched" column indicates that the category page for that specific category will use the default category page and content. You can preview the category page for both enriched and non-enriched categories by clicking the category name.

When you want to enrich a category page, you will need to open the category with default category page in the page editor. In order to do this, make sure you are still in the "Retail" view, locate the category you want to enrich and proceed to click the name of the category.

The category will be opened in the page editor and rendered using the default category page. In order to start enriching the category, proceed to activate "Enrich category page" button from the action ribbon. You will be asked to select a Template for your enriched category page. You can select the default category page if you wish to only perform slight modifications to it. You can also have category specific category page templates should you want to do that.

After you select the template to be used, you will be sent to page editor. New page has been created for the category you selected using the template you selected. Any modules using category specification data will use the date from your selected category. The page is checked out to you and you may proceed performing the modifications right after.
The modifications you can perform depend on the settings of the Template you selected. Typical category page enriching includes authoring category specific marketing content on the category page which might include cross-category product placement for cross-sell purposes, editorial lists, images, videos and text content.
