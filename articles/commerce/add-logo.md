# Add a logo
This topic describes how to add a site logo to your Dynamics 365 for Commerce website.

Probably one of the first things you'll do when building your site is to add your company or brand's logo to the header of the site. The Starter Kit for Dynamics 365 for Commerce contains a module that makes this task easy. 

## Prerequisites

Before you can add a logo to your site, you must

- Add your logo to the digital asset manager, which is accessed through the Assets tab
- Have a master template that includes the Header fragment you'll be editing in the instructions below
- Have a page that uses that master template 

To add a logo to the header for your site, follow these steps:

1. Open the Header fragment by going to the **Fragments** tab and selecting **Header**
2. Click **Check out** to make the Header fragment writeable 
3. Expand the **Header slot** and the **Logo slot**
4. Click the ellipsis to the right of the Logo slot and select **Add module**
5. Select the Logo module

Now you can configure the Logo module to display your logo. For an explanation of the properties in the Logo module, see the [Logo module](http://) help topic.
