# System requirements for e-Commerce developer environments

This topic lists the system requirements for setting up a Microsoft Dynamic 365 for Commerce e-Commerce developer extensibility environment. Before you install the extensibility software development kit (SDK) and tools (if you plan to install them), you should verify that the system that you're working with meets or exceeds the minimum hardware and software requirements.

## Operating systems

An e-Commerce extensibility environment requires Windows 10 (the latest publicly available version).

## Memory and hard drive requirements

At least eight gigabytes (GB) of RAM are recommended.

At least 20 GB of free hard drive space are recommended to run an e-Commerce extensibility environment.

## Supported web browsers

An e-Commerce extensibility environment can preview customizations in any of the following web browsers:

* Google Chrome (up to the current version minus 1)
* Internet Explorer 11
* Mozilla Firefox (up to the current version minus 1)
* Microsoft Edge (up to the current version minus 1)
