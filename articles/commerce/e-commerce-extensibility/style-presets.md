This topic describes how to add authorable style variables to a custom theme.

## Overview

A style preset is a stored set of all authorable style values across a site's theme. It can be used to immediately change the look of a site from site builder. Style presets let Commerce site builder authors quickly change, preview, and activate a set of style values across their site, without having to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) or deploy themes. Font styles, button styles, and site colors are typical examples of style variables that can be managed through style presets.


For more details on how the features works from the site builder tool see the [Work with style presets](../style-presets.md) documentation.
