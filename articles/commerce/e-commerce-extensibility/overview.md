# eCommerce platform extensibility

The Dynamics 365 for Commerce platform provides a rich eCommerce developer extensibility SDK and starter kit with a set of ready-built modules and data actions for your site.

eCommerce pages such as the home page, product details page, and category page are made up of componentized modules such as header, hero, and feature. The modules leverage data actions to fetch data (for example, Dynamics 365 for Retail data, ratings and reviews, etc.) and render html to make up a customer page. Each module can surface configuration fields that a page author or site administrator can fill out. Fields include layout options such as image placement within the module, links to products or pages, and images or strings to be displayed in the module.

## eCommerce SDK
The e-Commerce SDK enables a developer to customize e-Commerce modules, data actions and themes.

## Starter Kit
The starter kit contains production ready components, modules, data actions and themes that go along with pre-configured authoring templates and pages.  If needed each of the modules and themes can be modified by a developer using the e-Commerce SDK.

## CLI tools
CLI tools are provided as part of the e-Commerce SDK to help in creation of new modules, data actions and themes.  There is also a CLI tool to package up all of the configurations for your site into a single configurations file which will be uploaded to your production or test site via LCS.
