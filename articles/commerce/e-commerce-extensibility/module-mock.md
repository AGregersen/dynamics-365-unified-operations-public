# Module Mock
Most modules get data from data actions and config fields and present html based on that data.  When running a module in a local development environment, you're module may not have access to the data.  Module mock files are used to set data that your module can use to render when running your module locally through a browser. 

Mock data files are store under the `/src/MODULE_NAME/mocks` directory.  The default mock data file uses the MODULE_NAME.json file, but additional mock files can be added.  To specify different module mock files when testing in the browser by appending `:` to the module name and a comma separated list of mock files (without the .json file extension). 

Example: With a mock test file `mocks/MockTest1.json' use `http://localhost:4000/modules?type=productFeature:mockTest1`

Below is an example mock file used to mock `config` and `data` fields.
```
{
  "id": "R1Module1",
  "config": {
    "imageAlignment": "left",
    "productTitle": "Ethiopian Natural Limu",
    "productDetails": "Every 12 oz bag of our coffee is small batch roasted per order to guarantee freshness.  Available in a light or medium-dark roast.",
    "productImage": {
      "src" : "https://bit.ly/2LupO8u",
      "altText" : "Ethiopian Natural Limu"
    },
    "buttonText": "Buy Now",
    "productIds": "22565430170"
  },
  "data": {
    "actionResponse": {
      "text": "Sample Action Response"
    }
  },
  "typeName": "productFeature"
}
```
