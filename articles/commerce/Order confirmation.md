# Order confirmation

Order confirmation page is used to show a confirmation message once an order is placed. This page will have the Order confirmation module which shows the order confirmation number and the email address that was provided during checkout.

Once an order is placed during checkout, the order confirmation number and the email address are passed as query string to the order confirmation page. Order confirmation module receives the order confirmation number and the email address from the page url to render this module. Without this page context, the module will not be able to provide the status of the order.

## Usage in ecommerce:

* To show confirmation message once an order is placed.
