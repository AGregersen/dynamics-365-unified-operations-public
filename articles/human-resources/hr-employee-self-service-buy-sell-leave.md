# Buy and sell leave

You can submit requests to buy and sell leave based on the buy and sell leave policies set up by your company.  

## Request to buy leave

1. In the **Employee self service** workspace, select **Buy leave request** in the **Time Off Balances** tile. 

2. Add a **Leave type** and enter an **Amount** for the amount of leave you'd like to buy. 

3. Select **Submit** when you're ready to submit your request. 

Depending on how the buy policy has been configured, the request will either automatically update your balance with the amount you request to buy or will go through an approval process before balances are updated.
