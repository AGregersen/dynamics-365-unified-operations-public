# Manage leave requests in Teams

[!include [banner](includes/preview-feature.md)]

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources app in Microsoft Teams lets you quickly request time off and view your time-off balance information right in Teams. You can interact with a bot to request information. The **Time off** tab provides more detailed information.

## Install the app

You can find the Human Resources app in the Teams store.

1. In Microsoft Teams, select the ellipses.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don’t see a sign-in dialog, check your browser settings to allow pop-ups. 

If you have access to more than one instance of Human Resources, you can select which environment you want to connect to in the **Settings** tab.
 
## Use the bot

After the app installs, a welcome message appears, letting you know the types of actions the bot can take on your behalf.

> [!NOTE]
> When first interacting with the bot, you might need to sign in. If you don’t see a sign-in dialog, check your browser settings to allow pop-ups.

You can ask the bot to:

- Show time-off balance information for each leave type you're enrolled in.

- Show additional details about a specific leave type.

- Start a leave request for you.

After you start a leave request, you can adjust the days right within the card, or you can select **Edit details** to add additional information to your request.
