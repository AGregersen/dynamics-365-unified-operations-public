This topic covers the tasks associated with creating a new e-Commerce site in Dynamics 365  e-Commerce. 

To get started with development of your e-Commerce experience in Dynamics 365 e-Commerce, you'll start by establishing a new site in the site authoring environment. NOTE: New site creation requires that you have at least one online store created in HQ. For information and instructions on creating an online store, see the [Create a Dynamics 365 e-Commerce online store]() help topic.  

To set up your site, click the link in LCS that takes you to the site authoring environment. On the home page of the site authoring environment, click on **New site**. The New site dialog will open and will ask you to provide the following information:

| **Site name**                           | The display name   for your site within the site authoring environment. The name you give your   site is only visible within the authoring environment, it will not be shown to customers. |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Site Administrator's Security Group** | The Azure AD   security group that manages the users that perform the Site Administrator   role within this site. For more information about granting permissions to   users, see the [Manage users and roles](http://) topic. |
| **Online store**                        | Choose the online   store you created in Dynamics 365 that this site will serve as the web   storefront for. If you want your Dynamics 365 e-Commerce site to support   multiple online stores, you will associate them to your site through Site   Settings after your site is set up. |
| **Domain**                              | Select a domain   name that will serve as the domain for this online store. If you have not   configured any domains in LCS, this field may be left empty. Once your domain   is configured in LCS, you will add it to your online store through Site   Settings. See the [Configure your domain names](http://) topic to   learn more about how to set up domains for your site. |
| **Market**                              | Choose a country   that best represents this online store. If you choose to configure your site   to support multiple online stores, the value you enter here will be used to   guide your customers to the most appropriate online store given their   geographic location. For example, if your site supports a U.S. and Japan   store and a customer who resides in Japan is requesting a URL for your U.S.   store, you can show them a message that tells them you offer an online store   for their particular region. NOTE: After your site is set up, you can add   more markets to this online store. |
| **Language**                            | Specify the   language you want your customers to view content in for this online store and   market. An online store can support multiple languages. If you wish to   support multiple languages for this, or another online store, you can do that   through Site Settings after your site is set up. See the [Add   other languages to your site](http://) topic for more information on configuration   languages. |



Once your site is created, you can verify that it is associated with your online store by clicking on the **Retail** tab. You should see the products that have been assorted to that online store and be able to access them by category by using the dropdown in the upper-left.
